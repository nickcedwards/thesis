A measurement of the \ZZ production cross section in proton-proton collisions
at $\sqrt{s} = 7\TeV$ using data recorded by the ATLAS experiment 
at the LHC is presented.  
In a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
\lumi collected in 2011, events are selected which are consistent with two $Z$ bosons
decaying to electrons or muons, or consistent with one $Z$ boson
decaying to electrons or muons and a second $Z$ boson decaying to
neutrinos.   The \zzllll\ and \zzllvv\ cross
sections are measured in phase-space regions with good detector acceptance
and for masses within the range 66$\GeV$ to 116$\GeV$.
%to be 
%$\sigma_{ZZ\to \ll\ll}^\mathrm{fid} = $
%\fidllll\ and $\sigma_{ZZ\to \ll\nu\bar{\nu}}^\mathrm{fid} = $
%\fidllvv. 
This result is then used to derive the total cross section for \ZZ\
produced with \Z\ bosons in the mass range 66$\GeV$ to 116$\GeV$, $\sigma_{ZZ}^\mathrm{tot} = $ \totzz, which is consistent with the Standard Model
expectation of \theoryzzmass\ calculated at the next-to-leading order in QCD.
%Limits on anomalous neutral triple gauge boson couplings are derived.
The cross section fraction in bins of three kinematic variables is also presented, and 
the differential event yield as a function of the transverse momentum of the most energetic $Z$ 
is used to set the most stringent limits to-date on the presence of 
neutral triple gauge boson couplings in $ZZ$ production.
