\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis presents measurements of the \ZZ\ production cross section in proton-proton collisions
at \sqrtseq{7} and at \sqrtseq{8} using data recorded by the ATLAS experiment 
at the LHC in 2011 and 2012.  
Events are selected which are consistent with two \Z\ bosons decaying to
electrons or muons. The \cx\ is measured in a fiducial phase-space corresponding
closely to the detector acceptance. For the 7~\tev\ measurement, this volume is
defined by requring four electrons or muons with \ptgt{7}, \modetalt{3.16},
with minumum separation between any pair of leptons (electrons or muons) \deltaRlt{0.2}. The leptons
must form two \ossf\ pairs, each with invariant mass \sstooos. The fiducial \cx\
measure in a dataset corresponding to a luminosity of
\LumiPassGRLTwentyEleven\ifb\ is \ZZSevenTeVFiducialCrossSectionZZLLLL. For the 8~\tev\ measurement, the fiducial
volume is defined in the same way, but with the pseudo-rapidity requirement
reduced to \modetalt{2.7}. The fiducial \cx\
measure in a dataset corresponding to a luminosity of
\LumiPassGRLTwentyTwelve\ifb\ is \ZZEightTeVFiducialCrossSectionZZLLLL.
Addionally, a fiducial \cx\ allowing of the \Z\ bosons to be off shell, by
allowing one of the lepton pairs to have \mllgttwenty, is measured at
\sqrtseq{7}, and is found to be \ZZSevenTeVFiducialCrossSectionZZsLLLL.

These results are then used to derive the total cross section for \ZZ\
producwtion with \Z\ bosons in the mass range 66$\GeV$ to 116$\GeV$, by
correcting for the acceptance of the fiducial phase-space and the \Zll\
branching fractions. The total \cx\ is measure to be
\ZZSevenTeVTotalCrossSection\ at \sqrtseq{7} and \ZZEightTeVTotalCrossSection\ at
\sqrtseq{8}, which is consistent with the Standard Model
expectation of \ZZSevenTeVTheoryTotalCrossSection\ at \sqrtseq{7} and \ZZEightTeVTheoryTotalCrossSection\ at
\sqrtseq{8}, calculated at the next-to-leading order in QCD.
%Limits on anomalous neutral triple gauge boson couplings are derived.

The cross section fraction in bins of three kinematic variables is also presented, and 
the differential event yield as a function of the transverse momentum of the most energetic $Z$ 
is used to set the most stringent limits to-date on the presence of 
neutral triple gauge boson couplings in $ZZ$ production.
