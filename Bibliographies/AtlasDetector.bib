  abstract={The track reconstruction of modern high energy physics experiments is a very complex task that puts stringent requirements onto the software realisation. The ATLAS track reconstruction software has been in the past dominated by a collection of individual packages, each of which incorporating a different intrinsic event data model, different data flow sequences and calibration data. Recently, the ATLAS track reconstruction has undergone a major design revolution to ensure maintainability during the long lifetime of the ATLAS experiment and the flexibility needed for the startup phase. The entire software chain has been re-organised in modular components and a common event data model has been deployed. A complete new track reconstruction that concentrates on common tools aimed to be used by both ATLAS tracking devices, the Inner Detector and the Muon System, has been established. It has been already used during many large scale tests with data from Monte Carlo simulation and from detector commissioning projects such as the combined test beam 2004 and cosmic ray events. This document concentrates on the technical and conceptual details of the newly developed track reconstruction.}

  abstract={In the harsh environment of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (design luminosity of 10 34 cm -2 s -1 ) efficient reconstruction of the signal primary vertex is crucial for many physics analyses. Described in this paper are primary vertex reconstruction strategies implemented in the ATLAS software framework Athena. The implementation of the algorithms follows a very modular design based on object oriented C++ and the use of abstract interfaces. This guarantees the easy use and exchange of different vertex fitters and finders which are considered for a given analysis. Such a modular approach relies on a dedicated Event Data Model for vertex reconstruction. The data model has been developed alongside the reconstruction algorithms. Its design is presented in detail. The performance of the implemented primary vertex reconstruction algorithms has been studied on a variety of Monte Carlo samples and results are presented.}

  abstract={Vertex fitting frequently has to deal with both mis-associated tracks and mis-measured track errors. A robust, adaptive method is presented that is able to cope with contaminated data. The method is formulated as an iterative re-weighted Kalman filter. Annealing is introduced to avoid local minima in the optimization. For the initialization of the adaptive filter a robust algorithm is presented that turns out to perform well in a wide range of applications. The tuning of the annealing schedule and of the cut-off parameter is described using simulated data from the CMS experiment. Finally, the adaptive property of the method is illustrated in two examples.}
