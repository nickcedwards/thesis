ZZ Studies at LEP

L3 Paper - http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/9909043v1.pdf
---------------------------------------------------
Since 1997 LEP been at com high enough to produce ZZ.
First discovery at sqrt(s) = 183 GeV [2]
This paper - measurements at 189 GeV, 176 pb-1 collected in 1998.
Backgrounds: ee->ll(gamma), charged current 4-fermion process enuqq, lnulnu, multiperipheral processes (ee->eell, ee->eeqq)
Phase space: 70<m_ll<105 GeV, for vvll, uudd, ccss require the pairs that could come from W have <75 GeV or > 85 GeV (exclude W peak). reject electrons is |cos(theta_e)|>0.95 (reject if too collinear with beam?)

qqee, qquu - cut based. require 5 charged tracks, e_vis>0.4sqrts
qqtt - as above but also use a jet based selection - tag two jets as rom tau by forcing event into 4 jets and looking for two jets with less than 4 tracks.
require opening angle between leptons >120(130) for ee,mm(tt).
Apply kinematic fit requring energy and momentum conservation, the require mll and mjj 70-120 GeV. Require good jet resolution. in tau channel reject events with high et photon.
61% efficiency, 15 events, predict 10.9 signal, good data MC agreement.

qqvv - at least 15 calo cells and three tacks, event invarient mass > 50 GeV - reduces bg from purely leptonic two fermion final states and two photon interactions. but keeps qq(gamma) and WW. Require m_vis < 130 GeV and mass recoiling against hadronic system to be > 50 GeV. Require transverse momentum > 5 GeV and long momentum less than 40% of visible energy. <10 GeV in FCAL and EMiss > 16 deg from beam axis. Lepton veto and require Emiss isolated. At this point have 299 events - pred 23 signal, 266 bg. Use NN to distinguish - trained on event shapes, sum of invarient and missing masses, jet masses, emiss, emiss isonation. Increases S/B to 0.6 for cut of 0.5. Use full spectrum for cross section fit.

llvv - require dilepton pair with 85-95 GeV. require visible energy 75-98 GeV for electrons, 65-140 for muons. cuts on opening angle. backgrounds - radiative bhabha scattering and leptonic WW. require recoil mass to electron pair < 95 GeV. Reduce bg by imposing Z mass to lepton pair and recalculating their four mom. see 3 events - expect 0.7 signal, 0.6 bg

4l - reuiring four leptons (e,m,t) with pt > 3 GeV. require less than 15 calo clusters - low multiplicity events. If > 4 leptons, take four most consistent with energy momentum conserv. require at least one OSF SF pair. require the pair to have 75-105 gev, and apply same requirement to recoil mass. also use MIP muons to increase acceptance. see 2 events - expect 0.7, bg 0.6

qqqq - see 163, expect 24.2, bg 153. large QCD and WW bg. Select high multiplicity events by requiring e_vis 0.6-14 x sqrt s - veto events with e/m/g > 65 gev. Force event to 4 jets. fit event to rescale jet to momentum balance - reduces dependsance on energy scale. use NN to distinguish between 4 quark jets and 2 quark jets and 2 gluon jets (bg) - apply cut to reduce Z+jets bg. use second NN to distinguish ZZ and W by dijet mass differences after choosing pairings to minimise mass difference, also max and min jet energy, no tracks / jet. ZZ decays contain large bb fragment - distinguish from WW - add b-tag to NN. also carry out cut bases analysis using different boost of Z and W, so use opening angles, dijet mass differences, and dijet mean mass.

cx measurement - binned max likelihood fit on final variables (m_ZZ or NN outputs). Good agreement with SM. Combined cx 0.74±0.15 (stat) ±0.04 (syst) vs SM 0.662 pb.

systematics: correlated: bg cross sections, LEP enery, detector energy scale. uncorrelated: jet resolution, jet charged track multiplicity, b-tagging, bhabhbha background, MC stats and leptopn ID

also measured ZZ->bbX cross section using qqqq, and qqll and qqvv, adding b-tagging information to create a new discriminant and again doing binned likelihood fit. ZZ->bbX enhanced in SM/SUSY Higgs models

use binned likelihood fit for TGCs on discriminant distributions in each of the channels. Limits 1.2 - 5

183 GeV, 55.3pb-1
At 183 GeV can just produce on shell ZZ. Dominant diagram for on shell ZZ is "Conversion" - like qq diagram with ee.

Measure cross section for four fermion production in llqq and llll (mainly not on shell ZZ). Find good agreement with SM, statistically dominated.

Search for evidence of on shell ZZ in llll, llqq, qqvv, qqq and llvv and use to measure cx.
systematics - vary cuts within experimental resolution.

for eeee get enhancement of cs wrt mmmm (almost factor 2) due to "multiperipheral" diagram, where electrons "scatter" by radiating Zs coupled with a ff 3 sided box. 

On shell measurement: 70-105 GeV. Masses of fermion pairs that could be from W must not be 75-85 GeV. Measurement in good agreement with SM.

LEP Combination - 2006
----------------------
Measure NC02 Contribution to four-fermion cross-section (ie equivalent t and u qq graphs)
CoM energues 183 - 207 GeV.
At each energy combine measurements from the four experiments, taking into account correlations in the systematic uncertainties.
Good agreement with theoretical predictions from YFSZZ and ZZTO

TGCs:
	- Obtained from entire dataset above ZZ threshold. Experiments pre-combine different channels for their TGC measurements.
	- combination is based on the individual likelihood functions from the four LEP experiments. Each experiment provides the negative log likelihood, log L, as a function of the coupling parameters to be combined.
	- Do 1 and 2 parameter fits
	- LogL contains stat and uncorrelated syst uncertainty (detector effects, bg, fitting method, MC stats). For simplicity, treat LEP beam energy and other small correlated uncertainties as uncorrelated.
	- Theoretical cx uncertainty negligable so ignore.
	- Check ref 120,134 for combination method
	- refs for individual channels: 137,138, 141, 142]
	- The correlated systematic uncertainties are applied by scaling the likelihood functions by the squared ratio of the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainty over the total un- certainty including all correlated uncertainties.
	
Delphi TGC
----------
http://cds.cern.ch/record/1002930/files/cer-002664322.pdf
- use all visible channels apart from ttqq, ttvv, llll
- also use channels with bosons of shell, ee->uuqq
- ZZ cx very sensitive to TGC and increaseses with sqrts
- large interference between SM and anom amplit for CP conservice couplings, esp in differential cx wrt theta_Z, the Z production relative to beam axis. use fit to this to set limits
- limits set at energies up to 208 GEv, in total 638 pb-1
- use extended max likilhood fit on Z production angle in cuts based channels (qqll, llvv). In qqqq and qqvv, large background so simultaneous fit of cos theta_Z and ZZ probability.
- theta_Z free from ambiguity except in qqqq where can get wrong pairings
- rweight SM events to different TGC points

ALEPH TGC
--------
http://cds.cern.ch/record/1166743?ln=en
- use cross section and cos theta_Z

L3 TGC
--------
- kinematic variables depending on channel

OPAL

total cross section and cos theta_Z
