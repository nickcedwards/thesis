Calorimetry
------------

1. Overview
   - principle of calorimetry: measure particle energy through absorption of energy deposity in calo material. Measure psotiion by segmentation.
   - Particle showers (cascades)
   - ATLAS uses sampling clo - seperate absorpton from ebergy measurmeent - more compact design, shower containment.
   - Different absorbers needed depending on where em/strong, and different design, so segment.
   - ATLAS calo non compensating - hadron response is lower than response to em interacting partciles.
   - energy of an em shower normally fully detected.
   - energy of hadronic shower not due to escaping particles (muon, neutrino)
   - Calibration of energy response needed.
   
EM

- also called LAr. Uses liquid argon as active, lead as absorber.
- Charged particles ionise the LAr, electrons drift to copper electrodes in an e field.
- Barrels (2) up to 1.475, endcaps 1.375<3.2 in two coaxial wheels (1.375 ≤ |η| < 2.5 and 2.5 ≤ |η| < 3.2)
- crack 1.375 ≤ |η| < 1.52 is affected by additional material needed to instrument and cool the inner detector
- barrel has an accoridan sturcture to avoid azimuthal cracks, provide full phi smmetry and allow for fast readout
- lar in gaps between 1024 absorbers
- drift time 450ns in 2kV field
- Drift velocity enters energy measurement:  
	Tdrift is connected to the width of the gap wgap and the drift velocity vdrift as Tdrift = wgap/vdrift. In turn, the time dependence of the ionisation current I that is input to the energy measurement can be described using a baseline current I0 that again depends on the drift velocity: I(t) = I0(1 − t/Tdrift)
- So need to control HV, lar temp and density.
- lar gap is 2.11mm n barrel, depends on eta in EC, so voltage needs to vary with eta to get response independent from pseudorapidity.
- need to keep lar at about 88K
- three layers:
	First \delta \eta \times \delta \phi = 0.0031 \times 0.098 used to get particle eta and for PID (shower shape)
	Second \delta \eta \times \delta \phi = 0.0245 \times 0.025 is ~ 16 X_0 and contains largest fraction of energy in shower
	Third \delta \eta \times \delta \phi = 0.0245 \times 0.05 collects shower tail
- 22 to 33 X_0 traversed by particle in em calo.
- The first wheel of the LAr endcaps is segmented in three layers with a granularity equal to that of the barrel, while the second wheel (for larger pseudorapidities) has a coarser granularity that varies a function pseudorapidity.
- presample for |eta|<1.8 to correct for energy lost by indicent particles traversing material before the calorimeters.
