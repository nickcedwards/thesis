[06/03/2013 14:34:32] cjs_young: so for example you have:
1 -1 -> 23 23 21 21 (21 is gluon 23 is Z)[06/03/2013 14:35:26] Nick Edwards: yes[06/03/2013 14:35:47] cjs_young: it looks at this and says what vertices are allowed and finds; 
 1. it can group the two gluons to form a single gluon
 2. it can group a Z and a 1 or -1 
 3. it can group either of the gluons with any of the quarks[06/03/2013 14:36:02] cjs_young: it looks at the relative kt between these allowed pairings[06/03/2013 14:36:16] cjs_young: it then clusters the lowest kt pair[06/03/2013 14:36:32] cjs_young: eg. say it was a Z and 1[06/03/2013 14:36:57] cjs_young: then it has the remaining ones and looks for pairs again[06/03/2013 14:37:23] cjs_young: it continues this process until it is left with a 2->2 process which it can look at the Q^2 of[06/03/2013 14:38:09] cjs_young: this effectively selects the "most likely" feynman diagram and looks for the hardest vertex
