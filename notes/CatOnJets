clusters together topologically connected calorimeter cells and
classifies these clusters as either electromagnetic or hadronic.
Based on this classification energy corrections are derived from
single pion Monte Carlo simulations.[22/11/2012 15:10:59] stewbags: confused[22/11/2012 15:11:03] stewbags: because if they are electromagnetic[22/11/2012 15:11:12] stewbags: why would you correct them to single pion MC?[22/11/2012 15:11:14] Caterina  Doglioni: particle gun[22/11/2012 15:12:26] Caterina  Doglioni: i think the BR of picharged->pi0 is minuscule[22/11/2012 15:12:38] Caterina  Doglioni: i was making an absurd TB above[22/11/2012 15:12:45] Caterina  Doglioni: i think though[22/11/2012 15:12:53] Caterina  Doglioni: my trusted pdg is not with me[22/11/2012 15:13:15] Caterina  Doglioni: i think picharged also crashes through calo before making anything else[22/11/2012 15:13:20] stewbags: ok[22/11/2012 15:13:26] stewbags: so then no correction ends up being applied?[22/11/2012 15:13:42] Caterina  Doglioni: what do you mean?[22/11/2012 15:14:06] stewbags: ok so you classify a cluster as had -> correct to response from particle gun MC[22/11/2012 15:14:06] Caterina  Doglioni: you have the EM scale, which is made assuming everything that passes through your calo is EM only[22/11/2012 15:14:23] stewbags: ok so that's what happens to the clusters deemed to be EM?[22/11/2012 15:15:03] Caterina  Doglioni: no hadscale-related correction for clusters classified as EM for LC calibrated clusters, only dead material and OOC come in[22/11/2012 15:15:08] Caterina  Doglioni: OOC=out of cone[22/11/2012 15:15:15] stewbags: oh ok[22/11/2012 15:15:25] stewbags: but that's part of JES, not LCW right?[22/11/2012 15:15:30] Caterina  Doglioni: no, still LCW[22/11/2012 15:15:45] Caterina  Doglioni: if something ends up out of your cluster you still want to correct for as much as you can
