Thesis ToDo
------------

- ZZ Pheno: 
	- Generator level plots
			
		- minDR(l,l) after lepFid, ZZ cuts (need to add ZZ*)							[ have at 7 TeV, ZZ]
		
		- m_Z1, m_Z2 - 7 TeV only
			- nm1 lepFid, sorted by pT (show what we're selecting)								not in	
			
		- 7 TeV vs 8 TeV - normalise to cx?!?!?	
					
	- Exotics review - leave for now :s

- ObjSel:
	- Dilepton plots
	- Z+X plots
	- Trigger efficiencies: check if 2011 number have systematic, get 2012 numbers with systematic.
	- ==4 in 2012? do we see any events with >4?
	- Finish systematics bit
	- 8 TeV systematics

detector:
	- correct pixel sizes, check sqrt(12) resolution issue


- General:
	- wheredef towers? el-reco, but already mention in el-trigger
	- wheredef TRT only track?
	- wheredef hadronic tower - define em tower in forward el reco
	- wheredef PDF (prob density function) - first used in el-reco-improvements?
	- conv PDF / pdf
	- conv Inner Detector / ID / Inner detector
	- conv Muon Spectrometer / MS / Muon spectrometer
	- conv EM calorimeter / LAr / electromagnetic calorimeter
	- wheredef MS station? first mentioned mu-reco ST
