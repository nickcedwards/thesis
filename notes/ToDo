~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analysis issues:
	- Why so many more muon fakes in data?			{0.5 day}

- Theory:
	- Final readthrough
	
- ZZ Pheno: 
	- Say more about generator plots
	- Define MC sample
	
- ObjSel:					
	- Muon Fake rates
	- Final readthrough
		
- Background estimation 
	- Final readthrough
	   
- Cross Section and kinematic plots 
	- Final readthrough

- TGC limits and unfolding: 							{7 days??}
	- Skelaton write	
	- Run TGC limits code
	- Grid paramt stuff	
	
- SCT 						{2 days}
	- Wait

- Detector REDRAFT:			{0 day}
	- Final readthrough

- Reconstruction REDRAFT: {1 days}
	- Plot of d0Sig in GSF/STD in data?
	- Find out properly about HT hits in TRT and add to description
	- Own ID eff plots?

- Soak time				{2 days}
- Global redraft		{3 days}

- TOTAL: 20 days
- Available: 22.5 days MAX, including 2 flat out weekends	


- General:
	- wheredef towers? el-reco, but already mention in el-trigger
	- wheredef TRT only track?
	- wheredef hadronic tower - define em tower in forward el reco
	- wheredef PDF (prob density function) - first used in el-reco-improvements?
	- conv PDF / pdf
	- conv Inner Detector / ID / Inner detector
	- conv Muon Spectrometer / MS / Muon spectrometer
	- conv EM calorimeter / LAr / electromagnetic calorimeter
	- wheredef MS station? first mentioned mu-reco ST
