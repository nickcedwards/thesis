Thesis ToDo
------------

- Reco: Finish Chapter first pass
	- Jets - talk briefly about calibration
	- Reference for MUID?

- ZZ Pheno: 
	- Generator level plots
		- PowhegBox+ggZZ 7TeV vs 8 TeV (run at Glasgow) - ZZ_2011_1Oct, ZZ_2012_10Oct	[ OK ]
			- WARNING ZZ_2012_10Oct has tight lepFid
			- m_ZZ, pt_ZZ, pt_Z1
			- pT / eta l1/l2/l3/l4
			- apply mass  ZZ / ZZ* but NOT lepFid
			
		- minDR(l,l) after lepFid, ZZ cuts (need to add ZZ*)							[ have at 7 TeV, ZZ]
		
		- m_Z1, m_Z2 - sep for 7 TeV and 8 TeV
			- nm1 lepFid, sorted by pT (show what we're selecting)								[ have ]							
			- lepFid, m_Z1 (no mass cuts), m_Z2 (Z1 mass cut), ordered by closeness to pole 	[ running ]
				(show what we're cutting on)
				
 			- NoLepFid, m_Z1 (no mass cuts), m_Z2 (Z1 mass cut), ordered by closeness to pole  	[ not doing ]
 				?? not sure what it's showing, maybe not bother
 				
		- Comparison plots - 7 TeV only											[ OK ]
			- m_ZZ, pt_ZZ, pt_Z1, nJets, apply mass  ZZ / ZZ* and lepFid
			- pT / eta l1/l2/l3/l4,  apply mass  ZZ / ZZ* but NOT lepFid
			- mZ1/mZ2 nm-1
			
		- (llll) and (ll)(ll) comparison - have in plotsSherpaQED on glasgvr		[ OK ]
		
		- Comparison of ggZZ and ppZZ (7 TeV)												[ DONE ]
			- m_ZZ, pt_ZZ, pt_Z1
			- pT / eta l1/l2/l3/l4
			- apply mass  ZZ / ZZ* but NOT lepFid
			
		
			
	- MCFM Cross section
	- MC Simulation:
		- say a few words about which generators used for different processes
		- Powheg, ggZZ, Sherpa
		- Alpgen Z+jets
		- ttbar?
		- single top?
		- WW/WZ?
	- Gen level plots - some more words needed
	- TGC - write some bollocks
	- Exotics review - leave for now :s

- Theory: Write!

- General:
	- wheredef towers? el-reco, but already mention in el-trigger
	- wheredef TRT only track?
	- wheredef hadronic tower - define em tower in forward el reco
	- wheredef PDF (prob density function) - first used in el-reco-improvements?
	- conv PDF / pdf
	- conv Inner Detector / ID / Inner detector
	- conv Muon Spectrometer / MS / Muon spectrometer
	- conv EM calorimeter / LAr / electromagnetic calorimeter
	- wheredef MS station? first mentioned mu-reco ST
