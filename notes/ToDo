Thesis ToDo
------------

- ZZ Pheno: 
	- Generator level plots
			
		- minDR(l,l) after lepFid, ZZ cuts (need to add ZZ*)						[ have at 7 TeV, ZZ]
		
		- m_Z1, m_Z2 - 7 TeV only
			- nm1 lepFid, sorted by pT (show what we're selecting)								not in	
			
		- 7 TeV vs 8 TeV - normalise to cx?!?!?	
					
	- Exotics review - leave for now :s

- ObjSel:	{1 day}
	- Dilepton plots: Remake with hfor		WAIT TO RUN
	
	- Finish systematics bit

	- Make Z mass vs Z mass plot - 			DONE -> Add to thesis
	- 8 TeV systematics - 					DONE -> Add to thesis
	- 8 TeV C_ZZ details, 					DONE -> Add to thesis
		- mention comparisons with 2012
	- 8 TeV dilepton plots - 				RERUN MC GRID JOBS WITH E SCALES
	- 8 TeV Z+X plots - 					RERUN MC GRID JOBS WITH E SCALES

	- Add VVV and Vt samples						JOBS RUNNING
	- Check Higgs contamination (in background?)	DONE
	
- Background estimation: 
	- Do					{4 days}
	- Write 				{0 days}
	
- Cross Section and kinematic plots: 
	- Rerun 7 TeV cx with updates, finish writing {1 day}
	- 8 TeV bits			{0 days}
		- ZZ* plots
		- Z mass plots with mZ>7
		- dR vs ptZ plot? 

- Unfolding 
		- Write <1 day>
		- Play with unfolding code {1 day}

- TGC limits and unfolding:
	- Skelaton write		{2 days}
	- Run TGC limits code	{2 days}
	- Grid paramt stuff		{1 day}
	
- SCT 						{2 days}

- Detector REDRAFT:			{0 days}
	- sqrt(12) resolution issue - is from definition of std-deviation:
	- = sqrt(E((x-mu)^2)) = sqrt [ Int_{-L/2}^{L/2}x^{2}P(x)dx ]
	   with P(x) = 1/L
	   = sqrt[ x^{3}/3 |_{-L/2}^{L/2} ]
	   = sqrt[ L^{3} (1/24 - - 1/24)] = L/sqrt(12)
	- Describe Luminosity measurent

- Reconstruction REDRAFT: {0 days}
	- Plot of d0Sig in GSF/STD in data?
	- Find out properly about HT hits in TRT and add to description
	- Own ID eff plots?
	
- Exotics (?!)			{7 days}

- Theory redraft {1 day}
- Pheno redraft {1 day}

- Soak time				{5 days}
- Global redraft		{5 days}

- TOTAL: 33 days
- Available: 27 weekdays, 4 weekend days (MAX, ideally 5)
	


- General:
	- wheredef towers? el-reco, but already mention in el-trigger
	- wheredef TRT only track?
	- wheredef hadronic tower - define em tower in forward el reco
	- wheredef PDF (prob density function) - first used in el-reco-improvements?
	- conv PDF / pdf
	- conv Inner Detector / ID / Inner detector
	- conv Muon Spectrometer / MS / Muon spectrometer
	- conv EM calorimeter / LAr / electromagnetic calorimeter
	- wheredef MS station? first mentioned mu-reco ST
