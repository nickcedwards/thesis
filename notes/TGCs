-----------------------------------------

-> Effective lagrangian framework. Basic assumption is that there is some NP beyond SM with degrees of freedom (particles) are so heavy (mass scale \Lambda) that they are far beyond experimental reach. Only observable effect is anomolous interactions of normal SM particles. These can be described by effective L involving only operators for SM fields. If \Lambda >> obs energy, operators are dominated by lowest dimentional ones.

-> Need to satisfy Lorentz and U(1)_em gauge invairance

-> More complicated than charged TGCs since always at least two identical particles so need to consider constraints from Bose statistics -> fobids ZZV vertices with all particles on shell.

-> Most gen allowed form involved 2 indep couplings for each ZZV vertices, one CP even, one CP odd. apriori no relation between these couplings.

-> Simplest model for nTGCS would be heavy fermion loops (heavy scalar particles cannot generate netural self-couplings - why?) at one loop level. Can only generate CP-conserving coupings f_5^V, would be prop m_Z^2 / M_F^{2}
-> Get one loop alpha/4pi factor. Would need some sort of 

-> If family were exactly degenrate couplings would vanish as combination of heavy fermion contributions would be the same as the cancellation in the triangle anomaly (unbroken SU(2)xU(1) )
-> If allow splitting of EW size (m_Z^2) among multplets then get couplings prop m_Z^4 / M_F^{4}. Spontaneously broken SU(2)xU(1)
-> If get SU(2)xU(1) strongly broken, ie one particle much lighter get prop m_Z^2 / M_F^{2} coupling
-> For M_F in 100 GeV range get couplings of O(10-3)
-> For SM fermion loops get 10-4
 
-> CP conserving couplings lead to real amplitudes interfering with SM ones, so observables linearly sensitive to NP terms. CP viol param lead to purely imag amplitudes that do not interfere with SM, so observables depend only quadratically on NP terms and sensitivity limits decreased.

-> Form factors. At a given value of coupling departure from SM pred grows rapidly with s-hat and may rreach a unitarity violating size. Form factors applied to basic couplings with cutoff scale.
-> For fixed s-hat can  easily trasnlate between FF and no FF. For hadron collider, limits arise from integration over range over s-hat, so not trivial to do this.
-> Use of FF is somewhat in contradi ction with basic assumption that Lambda>>s-hat that to work with Effective Lagrangians keeping onl
y the lowest dimen-
sions. The additional s-hat dependence brought in by the form factor, would correspond to the presence of higher dimensional operators with a specific form. Therefore, we would prefer a treatment where no form factors are used, and one instead tries to stay within the basic assumptions; i.e. to keep working within the range Λ ≫ s-hat and far from the unitarity limit, by considering sufficiently small values for the anomalous couplings for
each s-hat domain.

->MSSM: Charginos and Neutralinos run in loops. Two chargnios contribute to f_5_Z,g, four neutralinos contribute only to f_5_Z
-> charginos couple to the gauge bosons through both their gaugino and higgsino components, whereas neutralinos only contribute through their higgsino components. T
