Vertexing
++++++++++

- needed for precision measurements, and rejecting background
- happens after tracking
- parameters stored: position in the global detector frame, quality and parameters of the vertex fit, track-to-vertex asso- ciations

- two stages:
	- associate tracks to candidates
	- fit for vertex position and covariance matrix
- Two vertex reconstruction strategies are implemented in the ATLAS: 
	- fitting-after-finding and 
	- finding-through-fitting.
	
- interaction region is described by a Gaussian with the standard deviation of 5.6 cm in the direction of the beam and 15 Î¼m in the perpendicular plane
	
Finding after fitting
======================
- e.g. InDetPriVxFinder
- preselect tracks originating from interacting region, order according to longitudinal impact parameter
- identify clusters of tracks using sliding window
- clusters treated as independent vertices
- fit, and check Chi2 of each track - consider outlier if prob of Chi2<8%
- use an iterative procedure that removes outliers and refit
- continue until no outliers left or cluster becomes too small to continue
- if track removed, doesn't get used again - n. vtx determined at clustering stage,
[78]

Finding through fitting
========================
- better handling of outliers
- default in ATLAS
- e.g. InDetAdaptiveMultiPriVxFinder
- identify tracks in IR, then create single vertex seed
- fit it, and tracks that don't fit are used to create a second seed
- fit two vertices simultaneously, and create new vertex out of removed tracks
- ....
- profit
- tracks that fail to be associated with any vertex with chi2 prob > 1% do not influence fit results

Fitting
=======
Adaptive Vertex Finding
- Kalman Filter used with least squares minimisation of distances from vertex.
- Outlier tracks down-weighted depending on compatability with vertex
- Down weighting gets progressively tighter
- Iterate until converged
