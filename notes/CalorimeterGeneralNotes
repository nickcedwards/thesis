Calorimetery general notes
--------------------------

+ Resoltuion improves with energy (unlike in tracker where degrades)
+ If hermetic can get missing Et measurement
+ fast for triggering

- non-linear response to charged hadrons
- HCAL needs to be big to get adequate containment at high energies.
- expensive, hard to design and build, hard to calibrate

basic prinicple - degrade energy of high E particles to the level of atomic ionsation and excitation.
Instrumented to detect ionisation and de-excitation and convert to electrical signal
Signal should be proportional to the energy of incident particle

EM-Calo
--------
Hih energy e/g interact via nucleus - brem and pair production. GEnerate cascade of particles.
Radiation length is distance that electrons energy drops to 1/e due to brem
Eventually electron energy drops below critical energy where ionisation loss per raditation length equal to el energy, ad electron dissipates all of its energy
photon showers tend to be slightly longer than electron shower

lateral development:
	- Moliere radius contains 90% of shower (but with long tails) ~X_0
	
Measurement:
	sampling calo - passive absorber interspersed with detector layers to sample ion energy
	homo (crystal/glass) (e.g. CMS lead-tungsten) in which active==passive. Exceptional energy resolution (few %/sqrt(E)) - very expensive so only used for EM
	
Sampling calo:
	MEasure ionisation energy dE/dX in sensitive detector
	Sampling fraction is sum(dE/dx)_active/sum(dE/dx)_passive
	Energy fraction linear, so for inf deep detector E_particle = Sum(dE/dX_active) * sampling frac
	Statistical rpocess - N_shower ~ E_particle/E_critical
	For EM shower E_critical is ~ energu at which ionisation dominates over pair prod.
	For had cascade is characterised by energy for pion multiplication
	So resoltuon sigma_E = 1 / sqrt(N) = 1/ sqrt(E)
	Also get contribution from fluctuations in path length = k sqrt(t_abs/ E)
	
Readout:
	Two approaches - scintilator or ionastion directly
	- Scintillator (solid / liquid). Excited atom relaxes emitting photons, catch through some sort of fibre and send to PMT / photo-diode. FAST, but only ~3% sampling frac, only 3% light collection fro tile to fibre, 50% attenuation in fibre, Quantum efficiency of sensor.
	- Ionisation (e.g. LAR!). Apply HV to sweep apart ion and liberated e. Colelct electrical signal. Ions have much smaller drift velocity, so first get fast positive peak then slow negative readout. I(t) = Qv/d. Q = Q_0(1-vt/d)
	
Complication: Sampling fraction changes as shower develops. At first dominated by MIP, later dominated by soft photons
	
CMS vs ATLAS (ECAL)
--------------------
CMS Lead-Tungstate - very good resoluiton of high E electrons. 
Best in barrel - sigma_E/E = 2.7%/sqrt(E) + 0.55% + 0.16/E


Hadronic Calorimetry
--------------------
Measured ionisation  = F(E_particle)
In ideal world F lnear and uniform accross all layers
In real world non-linear, and depends on particle type and energy
Different response to electronic and hadronic components (e/h != 1)
Very hard to model!!
	~25% of energy in shower is invisible - mainly neutrons, also change in binding energy as result of fission
	1% escaped energy (neutrinos)
	25% visible non-EM energy (dE/dx) (e.g. hadronic stuff which does ionise)
	EM energy ~50%

Shower defined by fraction of energy transferred to EM sector by prodution of pi0. About 1/3 of the energy per interaction

Shower has dense core of EM energy, hadronic tails.
Contribution from EM energy decreases with depth
Shower width increases linearly with depth x density
Get event by event fluctuations in depth due to fluctuations associated with deposition of EM energy. Correction needs to be event by event. Starting point for EM component varies wildly between events so little sample to sample correlation early in cascade
Also get fluctuations in binding energy - prinicipal mechanism for limiting precision of energy
