Muon Spectrometer
-----------------

Toroids
-------
- Muons deflected by large air core torioids outside the calorimeter system
- 3 in barrel, two in EC
- field (mostly) orthogonal to muons direction
- air core reduces deflections due to multiple scattering

For |eta|<1.4, barrel toroid provides 1.5 to 5.5 Tm of bending power
For 1.6<|eta|<2.7, EC toroid provides 1 - 7.5 Tm of bending power
In transition, combination of the two fields provides bending

-  Each of the three toroids consists of eight coils assembled radially and symmetrically around the beam axis.

General
--------
Precisions Chambers: MDT, Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC) - tracking in the bending plane (yz)

Triggering: Resistive Plate Chamber, Thin Gap Chamber - also tracking in the non bending plane (xy)

Designed to cover momentum range 3 GeV - 3 TeV

Stringent alignment requirements - met by precision mechanical assembly techniques and optical alignment systems.

Gaseous since need to cover large area with high resolution
MS magnets are air core, so little effect from multiple scattering. Resolution instead limited by position resolution of measurement.
The deviation from a straight line, or sagitta, of muons with pT=1TeV is 0.5 mm over at least 5m in the muon system.
The design goal of the muon system is to measure such muons to within 10% accuracy. To achieve this, the sagitta resolution must be 0.05 mm.

Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT)
----------------------------
Three layers covering |eta|<2.7
In innermost layer, replaced by CSC for 2.0<|eta|<2.7 to manage high rates and backgrounds in this region
Mechanical isolation of each sensor wire from neighbours guarantees robust and reliable.
Tubes run *along* phi direction, ie tangental to circle around beam. Thus get good resolution in R and Z (or R and eta)
Each chamber can measure one position (R) coordinate to within 40 μmand one angle to within (theta) 3 × 10−4 radians.
The size and long dead-time of the MDTs limit the muon hit rate they can handleto about 150 Hz cm−2.

Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC)
---------------------------
Is a multiwire proportional chamber with cathod segmented into strips - higher granularity than MDT.
Covers 2.0<|eta|<2.7

Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC)
-----------------------------
Triggering, second co-ordinate
|eta|<1.05

Thin Gap Chamber (TGC)
-----------------------------
Triggering, second co-ordinate
1.05<|eta|<2.7 (2.4 for triggering)

Trigger
-------
Covers |eta|<2.4, with time resoltuon of 1.5 - 4 ns
RPCs used in barrel, TGC in EC
