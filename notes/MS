Muon Spectrometer
-----------------

Toroids
-------
- Muons deflected by large air core torioids outside the calorimeter system
- 3 in barrel, two in EC
- field (mostly) orthogonal to muons direction
- air core reduces deflections due to multiple scattering

For |eta|<1.4, barrel toroid provides 1.5 to 5.5 Tm of bending power
For 1.6<|eta|<2.7, EC toroid provides 1 - 7.5 Tm of bending power
In transition, combination of the two fields provides bending

-  Each of the three toroids consists of eight coils assembled radially and symmetrically around the beam axis.

General
--------
Precisions Chambers: MDT, Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC) - tracking in the bending plane (yz)

Triggering: Resistive Plate Chamber, Thin Gap Chamber - also tracking in the non bending plane (xy)

Designed to cover momentum range 3 GeV - 3 TeV

Stringent alignment requirements - met by precision mechanical assembly techniques and optical alignment systems.

Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT)
----------------------------
Three layers covering |eta|<2.7
In innermost layer, replaced by CSC for 2.0<|eta|<2.7 to manage high rates and backgrounds in this region
Mechanical isolation of each sensor wire from neighbours guarantees robust and reliable.

Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC)
---------------------------
Is a multiwire proportional chamber with cathod segmented into strips - higher granularity than MDT.
Covers 2.0<|eta|<2.7

Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC)
-----------------------------
Triggering, second co-ordinate
|eta|<1.05

Thin Gap Chamber (TGC)
-----------------------------
Triggering, second co-ordinate
1.05<|eta|<2.7 (2.4 for triggering)

Trigger
-------
Covers |eta|<2.4, with time resoltuon of 1.5 - 4 ns
RPCs used in barrel, TGC in EC
