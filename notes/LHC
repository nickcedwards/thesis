LHC

studies towards 25ns
https://espace.cern.ch/acc-tec-sector/Chamonix/Chamx2012/talks/GR_2_01_talk.pdf

After the 25ns MDs, the LHC beam chambers have been cleaned to
d
max
values well below the build up threshold for nominal 50ns beams
If the present
level of machine conditioning was preserved,
‘
ecloud
-
less’
operation of LHC with 50ns beams
up
to high intensities
should be
possible in 2012
Only 2
-
3 days of scrubbing with 25ns beams for 50ns operation could be
sufficient
–
just to clean parts of the LHC open to air and check the
conditioning of the arcs
Scrubbing
of the arcs for 25ns operation could take up to
2 weeks
machine time
(including also test ramps)

electron cloud - Synchrotron radiation from proton bunches in the LHC creates photoelectrons at the beam screen wall.
These photoelectrons are pulled toward the positively charged proton bunch. When they hit the opposite wall, they generate secondary electrons which can in turn be accelerated by the next bunch. Depending on several assumptions about surface reflectivity, photoelectron and secondary electron yield, this mechanism can lead to the fast build-up of an electron cloud with potential implications for beam stability and heat load on the beam screen

=> Heat load and pressure rise
=> also beam sees electron cloud and loses energy, becomes unstable

scrubbing
The Synopsis.
" An adequate dose of photoelectrons, accelerated by lowintensity
proton bunches and hitting the LHC beam screen
wall, will substantially reduce secondary emission and
avoid the fast build-up of an electron cloud for the nominal
LHC beam. The conditioning period of the liner surface
can be considerably shortened thanks to secondary electrons,
provided heat load and beam stability can be kept
under control; for example this may be possible using a
special proton beam, including satellite bunches with an
intensity of 15-20% of the nominal bunch intensity and a
spacing of one or two RF wavelengths. Based on recent
measurements of secondary electron emission, on multipacting
tests and simulation results, we discuss possible
‘beam scrubbing’ scenarios in the LHC and present an update
of electron cloud effects."

transverse emittance and amplitude function
---------------------------------------------

transverse emittance
	- low emittance means particles are close together and with similar momentum
	- smallest operning you can squeeze the beam through
	- measure of parralism of beam
	- units of length, but referred to as length x angle
	
amplitude function (beta) 
	- width of the beam divided by the emittance
	- measure of how squeezed the beam is
	- beta high, beam is wide and straight, beta low beta narrow but will expand
