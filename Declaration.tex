I declare that the results presented here are the product of my own work, unless
explicit references are given in the text to the work of others. This thesis is
the result of the research I carried out in the Experimental Particle Physics
group in the School of Physics \& Astronomy of the University of Glasgow between
Sepember 2009 and March 2013. It has not been submitted for any other degree
at the University of Glasgow or any other institution.
