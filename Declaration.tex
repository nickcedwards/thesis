I declare that the results presented here are the product of my own work, unless
explicit references are given in the text to the work of others. This thesis is
the result of the research I carried out in the Experimental Particle Physics
group in the School of Physics \& Astronomy of the University of Glasgow between
Sepember 2009 and March 2013. It has not been submitted for any other degree
at the University of Glasgow or any other institution.

Due to the large nature of modern particl physics experiment, such as the ATLAS
experiment worked on by the author, results are produced in a very collaborative
manner, and the work presented in this thesis relies on the work of other
physicists. The main individual contributions of the author, chapter by chapter, are outlined below.

\chap{SCT}, SCT Temperature Monitoring: The SCT temperature monitoring study was
carried out entirely by the author, and involved writing monitoring software
extending the existing Oracle database. The author implement the automatic
publication of the monitoring plots to the existing SCT calibration monitoring
website.

\chap{Reconstruction}, Particle Reconstruction: The temperature

\chap{ObjEventSelection}, Object and Event Selection: The author played a
leading role in the development and optimiation of the selection requirements,
estimates of the selection efficiencies and systematics.

\chap{BackgroundEstimate}, Background Estimate: 

\chap{CrossSection}, Cross Section: 
\chap{TGCLimits}, TGC Limits:
