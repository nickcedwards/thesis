\chapter*{Declaration}
I declare that the results presented here are the product of my own work, unless
explicit references are given in the text to the work of others. This thesis is
the result of the research I carried out in the Experimental Particle Physics
group in the School of Physics \& Astronomy of the University of Glasgow between
Sepember 2009 and March 2013. It has not been submitted for any other degree
at the University of Glasgow or any other institution.

\chapter*{Authors Contributions}

Due to the large nature of modern particle physics experiments, results are produced in a very collaborative
manner, and the work presented in this thesis relies on the work of other
physicists. The main individual contributions of the author are outlined below:

\chap{SCT}, SCT Temperature Monitoring: The SCT temperature study was
carried out entirely by the author. The author implement the automatic
publication of the monitoring plots to the existing SCT calibration monitoring
website.

\chap{ObjEventSelection}, Object and Event Selection: The author played a
leading role in the development and optimisation of the selection requirements,
estimates of the selection efficiencies and systematics.

\chap{BackgroundEstimate}, Background Estimate: The author contributed to the 
development of the data-driven background estimate method, in association with other members
of the ATLAS \ZZ\ working-group, and provided a cross-check of the final
results (the results presented in the chapter being entirely the work of the
author). The author produced the \mc\ based background estimates.

\chap{CrossSection}, Cross Section: The author produced all results for
this chapter.

\chap{TGCLimits}, TGC Limits: The \AfterBurner\ reweighting code and the TGC
limit setting methodology were developed by other members of 
ATLAS. The 7~\tev\ TGC limit results were initially produced by
other members of the \ZZ\ group, using inputs from the author on expected
yields and systematics. The author subsequently cross-checked these results. For
the 8~\tev\ limits, the author carried out the bin optimisation study and
produced the limits.
