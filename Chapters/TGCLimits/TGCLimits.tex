\section{Limit Setting Procedure}

\subsection{Matrix Element Reweighting}
\label{sec:TGC-reweighting}

As described in~\sec{TheoryZZ-TGCs}, anomalous neutral triple gauge couplings affecting \ZZ\
production are described by four parameters, \ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg\ and
\ffiveZ.
Since the parameters enter linearly in the effective Lagrangian
(\eqn{tgc-lagrangian}), they will appear
quadratically in the amplitude of the \ZZllll\ process. The differential \cx\
can thus be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:dsigma}
{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC} & = & F_{00} + f_4^\gamma F_{01} + f_4^Z F_{02} + f_5^\gamma F_{03} + f_5^Z F_{04}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^\gamma\right)^2F_{11} + f_4^\gamma f_4^Z F_{12} +  f_4^\gamma f_5^\gamma F_{13} + f_4^\gamma f_5^Z F_{14}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^Z\right)^2F_{22} + f_4^Zf_5^\gamma F_{23} + f_4^Zf_5^Z F_{24}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^\gamma\right)^2F_{33} + f_5^\gamma f_5^Z F_{34} \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^Z\right)^2F_{44}
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{ij}$ are coefficients describing how the \cx\ changes in the presence
of \TGC s. A priori, there are 25 coefficients, however, using the 
symmetry property of the coefficients ($F_{ij}=F_{ji}$), it is seen 
that only $25-10=15$ are independent. $F_{00}$ corresponds to the contribution
of the \sm\ diagrams and the rest consist of operator contributions associated with the
anomalous couplings. 

A simulated event generated assuming only \sm\ couplings can be assigned a weight corresponding to the differential \cx\
assuming \TGC\ couplings at some specific value of the four parameters:
\begin{equation}
{\rm weight} = \frac{{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC}(\ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg,
\ffiveZ)}{{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM}}
\end{equation}
By assigning such a weight to every event in the sample, it is possible to reweight a sample
generated with only \sm\ couplings to a sample with \TGC\ couplings.
This procedure can be easily extended to reweight a sample generated assuming
any given set of \TGC s to any other set of \TGC s. For example, to reweight a sample
generated assuming only \sm\ couplings to sample assuming \ffourg=0.1, one would
apply to each event a weight:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{revisit}
{\rm weight} = \frac{F_{00} + 0.1 \cdot  F_{01} + (0.1)^{2} \cdot
F_{11}}{F_{00}}
\end{eqnarray}
The \Fij\ coefficients are completely
specified by the kinematics of the incoming and outgoing particles, and so must
be evaluated on an event by event basis. They are
independent of the values of the anomalous coupling parameters, although they do depend on
the choice of \formfactor. The coefficients are determined using matrix elements for
\ZZllll\ production in the presence of \TGC s, as follows. By using Equation~\ref{eqn:dsigma} it 
is possible to write down 15 equations that uniquely determine the 
coefficients $F_{ij}$ in terms of matrix elements assuming particular values
for the \TGC\ couplings.
To illustrate the procedure, consider the simplified situation where 
there is just one coupling constant $f$. In this case, there are 3 coefficients 
to be determined:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{revisit2}
{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC} = F_0 + fF_1 + f^2F_2 
\end{eqnarray}
where  $F_0={\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM}$.

Using three different values of $f$, e.g $f=\{0,1,-1\}$, three independent
equations may be written down:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{matrix1}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
{\rm d}\sigma_1\\
{\rm d}\sigma_2\\
{\rm d}\sigma_3
\end{array}\right) =
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\left(\begin{array}{c}
F_0\\
F_1\\
F_2
\end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
Denoting the matrix containing the coupling values $\hat{A}$, the \cx s
\dsigmavec\ and the coefficients $\vec{F}$, the equations are easily
manipulated to give the coefficients 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{matrix2} \dsigmavec=\hat{A}\vec{F} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \vec{F}=\hat{A}^{-1}{\rm
\bf d}\vec{\sigma} 
\end{eqnarray} 
This requires that $\hat{A}$ must be invertible. This is the
case if the couplings are chosen such that the three equations in~\ref{matrix1}
are independent. When considering all four couplings at the same time, the
matrix $\hat{A}$ is 15$\times$15 and \dsigmavec\ and $\vec{F}$ are
15-dimensional vectors.

The \TGC\ matrix elements are obtained from the next-to-leading order \mc\
generator \BHO~\cite{bho}. Matrix elements from the leading-order \BR\
generator~\cite{Baur:1994au} are also used as a cross-check. The matrix
elements are introduced into the  framework described in~\cite{Bella:2008wc},
which enables a calculation of the amplitude given the four-vectors and PDG
codes of the incoming partons and outgoing particles from the hard process. 

Whilst it is possible to reweight a \sm\ sample to a \TGC\ point, this suffers
from a lack of statistics in the tails of distributions such as the \Z\ boson \pt\ 
and the four-lepton invariant mass, where the presence of \TGC s
enhances the \cx\ at high momentum and high invariant mass. Instead,
samples generated with values of the \TGC\ couplings set near previously set
experimental limits are used; this ensures statistics in the tails of the
distributions of interest. The \powhegbox\ and \ggZZ\ generators used to generate the nominal signal
samples do not model \TGC s; instead the samples are generated using \sherpa,
which does. For the 7~\tev\ analysis, four samples are used, with couplings
 $\{f_{4}^{\gamma}=0.1\}$, $\{f_{5}^{\gamma}=-0.1\}$,
$\{f_{4}^{\gamma}=0.1$ \& $f_{5}^{\gamma}=0.1\}$, and 
$\{f_{4}^{Z}=0.1$ \& $f_5^{Z}=0.1\}$. For the 8~\tev\ analysis, three sample are
used, with couplings $\{\ffourg=0.1\}$ (denoted TGC0),
$\{\ffourg=0.1 \,\&\, \ffiveZ=0.1\}$ (denoted TGC1), and 
$\{ \ffourg = \ffourZ = \ffiveg = \ffiveZ = 0.1 \}$ (denoted TGC2). The 7~\tev\ samples are
generated with a \formfactor\ of $\Lambda=2\tev,n=3$; the 8~\tev\ samples are
generated without a \formfactor. The reweighting procedure can of course be used to
reweight samples generated with one \formfactor\ (or no \formfactor) to another
\formfactor.

\subsection{Validation of Reweighting Procedure}

To demonstrate the performance of the reweighting procedure, the 8~\tev\ \sherpa\
samples generated with \TGC s are reweighted to the \sm, and
compared to a sample generated with only \sm\ couplings. Additionally, the TGC1 and TGC2
samples are reweighted to the TGC0 sample. \fig{TGC-reweight} shows the
resulting distributions of the leading \Z\ boson \pt, and the ratios of
the reweighted samples to the \sm/TGC0 distribution, for reweighting carried out
using either the \BHO\ or the \BR\ matrix elements. For both the generators, the reweighted samples are seen
to agree well with the directly generated samples.

\subsection{Yield Coefficients}

In order to extract limits on the \TGC s, an estimate of the number of expected events as a
function of the \TGC\ couplings must be obtained. The expect yield is parameterised by
yield coefficients \Yij, which are be obtained from the \Fij\ as:
\begin{equation}
\Yij = \left( \sum_{\rm events} \frac{F_{ij}}{F_{00} } \right) \cdot{N_{\rm expected}}.
\end{equation}
where $N_{\rm expected}$ is the \sm\ number of expected events, obtained from the
nominal signal sample, and the sum is over events passing the full event
selection. Event-level lepton selection efficiency, energy scale, and resolution corrections
are taken into account when calculating the yield coefficients. A different set of yield
coefficients is needed for each bin of the differential distribution used to set
the limits and for each choice of
form-factor. The expected yield as a function of the TGC couplings is given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:Nexp_TGC}
N_{exp} (\ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg, \ffiveZ) & = & Y_{00} + f_4^\gamma Y_{01} + f_4^Z Y_{02} + f_5^\gamma Y_{03} + f_5^Z Y_{04}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^\gamma\right)^2Y_{11} + f_4^\gamma f_4^Z Y_{12} +  f_4^\gamma f_5^\gamma Y_{13} + f_4^\gamma f_5^Z Y_{14}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^Z\right)^2Y_{22} + f_4^Zf_5^\gamma Y_{23} + f_4^Zf_5^Z Y_{24}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^\gamma\right)^2Y_{33} + f_5^\gamma f_5^Z Y_{34} \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^Z\right)^2Y_{44}
\end{eqnarray}

shows the expected total event yield for the 8~\tev\ analysis as a function of
the four \TGC\ parameters. In each case, the other parameters are set to zero.
The solid blue shows the yields with a \formfactor\ of $n=3, \Lambda=3~\tev$;
the dashed red curve shows the yields with no \formfactor. The increase of event
yield with the strength of the coupling is reduced as a result of applying the
\formfactor.

%the differential distributions are shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix:tgc-coeff}.

\subsection{Limit Setting}

%on the number of observed events in each bin
%of the differential distributions, with systematic uncertainties introduced as
%nuisance parameters. 
95\% confidence level (CL) intervals for the \TGC\ parameters are determined
using a frequentist maximum profile-likelihood based method~\cite{Cowan:2010js},
combining the three \lllplp\ final states prior to
the profile-likelihood maximisation. The likelihood function is similar
to that used in the \cx\ calculation, but parametrised in terms of the
number of events in each bin instead of the \cx. Systematic uncertainties are
again introduced as nuisance parameters 
represented as Gaussian terms ($G$); since there are nuisance
parameters for both signal and background, the set of nuisance parameters giving
the fractional uncertainty on the signal and background expectation for a
distribution of $m$ bins is expressed as:
$\vec\beta = \{\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_{2m}\}$, where:
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{true }N_\mathrm{sig}^i &=& N_\mathrm{sig}^i \cdot (1 + \beta_i) \label{nuis1}\\
\text{true }N_\mathrm{bkg}^i &=& N_\mathrm{bkg}^i \cdot (1 + \beta_{i+m}) \label{nuis2}
\end{eqnarray}
The systematics associated with the theoretical calculation of the fiducial \cx\ in each bin
(due to PDF and scale uncertainties) are assumed to be 100\% correlated between
bins, as are systematic uncertainties on the data-driven background estimate.
Bin by bin correlations of systematics on the expected yield due to
reconstruction uncertainties are propagated for each source of uncertainty via the
covariance matrix. 

The likelihood function is:
\begin{equation}
L(\vec{f}, \vec{\beta}) =
\prod_{i=1}^{m}P(N_\mathrm{obs}^i,\mu^i(\vec{f},\vec\beta))
\times
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^m}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\vec\beta\cdot C^{-1}\cdot\vec\beta\right)},
\label{likelihood}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{f}=\{\ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg, \ffiveZ \}$ are the \TGC\
parameters, $C$ is the covariance matrix, and $\mu^{i}$ is the expected number of events in bin $i$:
\begin{equation}
\mu^i(\vec{f},\vec{\beta})
= N_\mathrm{sig}^i(\vec{f})(1 + \beta_i) + N_\mathrm{bkg}^i(1 + \beta_{i+m}).
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm sig}(\vec{f}) = \left( Y_\mathrm{\rm SM} + \sum_{i,V} (Y_{f_i^V}\cdot
f_i^V + Y_{f_i^Vf_i^V}\cdot (f_i^V)^2 ) \right) \cdot\mathcal{L}\cdot{C_{ZZ}}.
\end{equation}

A test statistic \teststat\ is constructed as the ratio of the \maxprofilellh\
at a specific test value of the \TGC\ parameters $\vec{f}$ to the full \maxprofilellh:
\begin{equation}
\teststat =
\frac{L(N|\vec{f},\vec{\hat{\hat{\beta}}})}{L(N|\vec{\hat{f}},\vec{\hat{\beta}})}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\betahathat}$ is the value of $\vec{\beta}$ that maximises the
numerator, and $\vec{\hat{f}}$ and $\vec{\hat{\beta}}$ are the values of
$\vec{f}$ and $\vec{\beta}$ that maximise the numerator. The distribution of
\teststat\ in the assumption of \TGC\ couplings at the test value of $\vec{f}$
is obtained by generating 10,000 pseudo experiments. In each
pseudo experiment, the nuisance parameters $\vec{\beta}$ are Gaussian
fluctuated around the mean value of $\vec{\betahathat}$ and the `observed' number of events
is drawn randomly from a Poisson distribution with a mean corresponding to the
values of $\vec{f}$ and $\vec{\beta}$. The $p$-value at the test value of the
couplings is calculated as the fraction of pseudo-experiments which have a test
statistic smaller than the observed value of the test statistic $\teststat_{obs}$.
This procedure is repeated scanning possible values of $\vec{f}$. The 95\%
confidence interval is defined by all values of $\vec{f}$ for which
$p(\vec{f})\geq 5\%$. 

Limits are set for one parameter at a time, holding the other parameters at
their \sm\ values of zero. The expected sensitivity is also obtained using
pseudo-experiments. In each pseudo-experiment, $N^{i}_{sig}$ and $N^{i}_{bg}$
are given by the \sm\ expectations but allowed to fluctuate within their
uncertainties.

\section{Bin Optimisation}

For the 7~\tev\ analysis, limits were set using the total number of observed
events, and by using the number of events observed in bins of the leading \Z\
boson candidate \pt\ and in bins of the mass of the four-lepton system. It was found that
binning in the leading \Z\ boson \pt\ yielded the most stringent expected limits, and
that the tightest expected limits were obtained using four bins of \pt\ with boundaries 0-60,
60-100, 100-200 and $>$ 200~\GeV. A combined fit with the results of a \ZZllvv\
analysis was also carried out, using three bins of the leptonically decaying \Z\
candidate for the \ZZllvv\ events.

For the 8~\tev\ analysis, a bin optimisation was carried out, varying
the number of bins and the bin boundaries. For each variation, a set of 5,000
pseudo-experiments is carried out in order to derive the expected limit. The systematic uncertainties on the expected signal
in each bin are re-evaluated, as well the theoretical uncertainties on the
differential \cx. The estimated irreducible background is re-derived from the
\mc. An estimated for the reducible background in each bin is obtained by dividing the total
data-driven reducible background estimate according to the background shape obtained from data. The
fractional systematic and statistical uncertainties on the data-driven background
estimate are assumed to be the same in every bin. No systematic to
account for uncertainties on the reducible background shape is assigned. This
approximation is justified by the fact that the total background uncertainty is
already large, and that the background contribution when the leading \Z\ has
\pt\ above 100~\gev\ is very small.
This procedure means that large statistical and systematic uncertainties on the
expected signal and large PDF and scale errors on the fiducial \cx\ when the last bin boundary is
very high are taken into account in the expected limits. It does
not, however, take into account the fact that there may be insufficient \mc\
statistics associated with the estimate of the reconstruction systematic uncertainties when
there are limited statistics in the \sm\ \mc\ sample in the last bin. Therefore
before choosing a final binning it is checked that the statistics in the last
bin are sufficient to properly evaluate the systematics.

A variety of choices of binning were tried, varying the number of bins from one
to five, and varying the boundaries of the bins. It is observed that the
observed limits are most sensitive to the lower boundary of the last bin, which
is taken to be inclusive (i.e. including all events with \Z\ boson \pt\ greater
than the lower bin boundary). The limits are observed not to be very sensitive
to the number of bins or the boundaries of the bins other than the last.
\fig{TGC-binOpt} shows the expected limit on \ffourg\ as a function of the lower
boundary of the last bin. Limits obtained using different numbers of bins are
shown as different coloured markers. The expected limits become more stringent
as the lower boundary of the last bin increases, but varying the bin boundaries
other than the lower boundary of the last bin has little effect on the expected
limits.  The tightening of the limits as the boundary of the last bin is
increased is because the relative increase in signal yield due to the existence
of \TGC s is much larger at higher \Z\ boson \pt. It is seen that beyond
300~\gev\ the limits do not significantly improve, since past this point the
signal expectation in the case of \sm\ couplings only becomes very small, and so
increasing the bin boundary further does little to increase the significance of
the \TGC\ signal. Beyond 550~\gev, the expected limits worsen; this is because
the statistical, systematic, and theoretical uncertainties on the expected
signal become very large, as can be seen in~\fig{TGC-uncertainties} which shows
the percentage uncertainty due to the signal and background statistical and
systematic uncertainties, and from theoretical uncertainties on the fiducial
\cx, for a variety of choices of binning.
%Full details of the different bin boundaries tried
%are given in~\app{}.

The final limits are set using two bins of leading \Z\ boson \pt: 0-300 and $>$
300~\gev. This binning was chosen as it gives similar limits to choices of
binning where the last bin boundary is higher in \pt, but retains sufficient
statistics in the signal \mc\ in order to estimate the systematic uncertainties.
Increasing the number of bins was not seen to give any improvement in the
expected limits, so for computational convenience the binning with the lowest
number of bins was chosen.
