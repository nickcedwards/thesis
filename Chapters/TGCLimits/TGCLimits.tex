\chapter{Limits on Anomalous Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings}
\label{chap:TGCLimits}

As discussed in~\sec{TheoryZZ-TGCs}, the presence of the anomalous neutral
triple gauge couplings (\TGC s), \ZZZ\ and \ZZg, present in some models of new
physics, would lead to an increase in the
\cx\ for \ZZ\ production, particularly at high momentum transfer. Observables
such as the mass of the four-lepton system and the transverse momenta of the \Z\
bosons and their decay products are therefore particularly sensitive to \TGC s.
The observed \ZZllll\ events are used to search for
such couplings, and in the absence of any evidence for them, to set limits on
the size of the couplings. The limits are obtained by performing a binned fit of
the \pt\ distribution of the leading \Z\ boson, although other variables are considered. Only
the \ZZ\ (on-shell) events are used. Separate limits are set using the 7~\tev\
and the 8~\tev\ data; for the 7~\tev\ analysis, limits are set in combination
with observed \ZZllvv\ events; see~\cite{ATLAS:2012kg} for a description of the
\ZZllvv\ analysis. Limits are set using a \formfactor\ with $n = 3$ and $\Lambda
= 3 \TeV$; these values are chosen so that expected limits
are within the values allowed by requiring that unitarity is not violated at LHC energies~\cite{Baur:2000ae}.
Limits are also presented without applying a \formfactor\ (i.e.
$\Lambda=\infty$).
%are also presented as a 
%comparison in the unitarity violating scheme.

The limit setting procedure is described in~\sec{TGC-methodology}. A bin
optimisation study is presented in~\sec{TGC-BinOpt}, and the robustness of the
limits under variations in the limit setting method are described
in~\sec{TGC-Robustness}. Finally, the expected and observed limits are given
in~\sec{TGC-ExpObsLimits}.

\section{Limit Setting Procedure}
\label{sec:TGC-methodology}

In order to set limits it is necessary to parametrise the expected yield in
terms of the strength of the \TGC s. One method for doing this would be
to generate a grid of \mc\ samples at different coupling strengths. This is,
however, very computationally intensive. Instead, a matrix element reweighting procedure
is used to reweight a sample generated with one set of coupling strengths to another.
This is described in more detail below. Once the parameterised expected yields
are obtained, 95\% confidence interval limits on the \TGC s are set using a
frequentist likelihood-ratio method. This is also described below.

\subsection{Matrix Element Reweighting}
\label{sec:TGC-reweighting}

As described in~\sec{TheoryZZ-TGCs}, the anomalous \TGC s affecting \ZZ\
production are described by four parameters: \ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg\ and
\ffiveZ.
Since the parameters enter into the effective Lagrangian linearly 
(\eqn{tgc-lagrangian}), they will appear
quadratically in the amplitude for the \ZZllll\ process. The differential \cx\
can thus be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:dsigma}
{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC} & = & F_{00} + f_4^\gamma F_{01} + f_4^Z F_{02} + f_5^\gamma F_{03} + f_5^Z F_{04}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^\gamma\right)^2F_{11} + f_4^\gamma f_4^Z F_{12} +  f_4^\gamma f_5^\gamma F_{13} + f_4^\gamma f_5^Z F_{14}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^Z\right)^2F_{22} + f_4^Zf_5^\gamma F_{23} + f_4^Zf_5^Z F_{24}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^\gamma\right)^2F_{33} + f_5^\gamma f_5^Z F_{34} \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^Z\right)^2F_{44}
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{ij}$ are coefficients describing how the \cx\ changes in the presence
of \TGC s. A priori, there are 25 coefficients, however, using the 
symmetry property of the coefficients ($F_{ij}=F_{ji}$), it is seen 
that only $25-10=15$ are independent. $F_{00}$ corresponds to the contribution
of the \sm\ diagrams and the rest consist of operator contributions associated with the
anomalous couplings. 

A simulated event generated assuming only \sm\ couplings can be assigned a
weight corresponding to the increase in differential \cx\
due to \TGC s at a specific value of the four parameters:
\begin{equation}
{\rm weight} = \frac{{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC}(\ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg,
\ffiveZ)}{{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM}}
\end{equation}
By assigning such a weight to every event in the sample, it is possible to reweight a sample
generated with only \sm\ couplings to a sample with \TGC s.
This procedure can be easily extended to reweight a sample generated assuming
any given set of \TGC s to any other set of \TGC s. For example, to reweight a sample
generated assuming only \sm\ couplings to sample assuming \ffourg=0.1, one would
apply to each event a weight:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{revisit}
{\rm weight} = \frac{F_{00} + 0.1 \cdot  F_{01} + (0.1)^{2} \cdot
F_{11}}{F_{00}}
\end{eqnarray}
The \Fij\ coefficients are completely specified by the kinematics of the
incoming and outgoing particles, and so must be evaluated on an event by event
basis, and the weight for each event must be calculated separately; the
reweighting is thus fully differential. The \Fij\ are independent of the values of the anomalous coupling parameters
assumed in the generation of the sample, although they do depend on the choice of
\formfactor. 

The coefficients are determined from the matrix elements for \ZZllll\
production in the presence of \TGC s, as follows. By using
Equation~\ref{eqn:dsigma} it is possible to write down 15 equations that
uniquely determine the coefficients $F_{ij}$ in terms of matrix elements
assuming particular values for the \TGC s.  To illustrate the procedure, it is
convenient to consider the simplified situation where there is just one coupling
parameter $f$.
In this case, there are 3 coefficients to be determined:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{revisit2}
{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC} = F_0 + fF_1 + f^2F_2 
\end{eqnarray}
where  $F_0={\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM}$. Using three different values of $f$, e.g $f=\{0,1,-1\}$, three independent
equations may be written down:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{matrix1}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
{\rm d}\sigma_1\\
{\rm d}\sigma_2\\
{\rm d}\sigma_3
\end{array}\right) =
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\left(\begin{array}{c}
F_0\\
F_1\\
F_2
\end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
Denoting the matrix containing the coupling values $\hat{A}$, the \cx s
\dsigmavec\ and the coefficients $\vec{F}$, the equation may be
inverted to give the coefficients:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{matrix2} \dsigmavec=\hat{A}\vec{F} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \vec{F}=\hat{A}^{-1}{\rm
\bf d}\vec{\sigma} 
\end{eqnarray} 
This requires that $\hat{A}$ must be invertible. This is the
case if the coupling parameters are chosen such that the three equations in~\ref{matrix1}
are independent. When considering all four couplings at the same time, the
matrix $\hat{A}$ is 15$\times$15 and \dsigmavec\ and $\vec{F}$ are
15-dimensional vectors.

The differential \TGC\ matrix elements are obtained from the \BR\ code~\cite{Baur:2000ae};
matrix elements from the \BHO~\cite{bho} code are also used as a \crosscheck.
%The \TGC\ matrix elements are obtained from the next-to-leading order \mc\
%generator \BHO~\cite{bho}. Matrix elements from the leading-order \BR\
%generator~\cite{Baur:1994au} are also used as a \crosscheck. 
The matrix
elements are introduced into the  framework described in~\cite{Bella:2008wc},
which enables a calculation of the amplitude given the four-vectors and PDG
codes of the incoming partons and outgoing particles from the hard process. 

Whilst it is possible to reweight a \sm\ sample to an \TGC\ point, this suffers
from a lack of statistics in the tails of distributions such as the \Z\ boson
\pt\ and the four-lepton invariant mass, which are the regions of greatest
interest when studying \TGC s. Instead, samples generated with values of the
\TGC\ parameters set near previously derived experimental limits are used; this
ensures statistics in the tails of the distributions of interest. The
\powhegbox\ and \ggZZ\ generators used to generate the nominal signal samples do
not model \TGC s; instead the samples are generated using \sherpa, which does.
For the 7~\tev\ analysis, four samples are used, with couplings
$\{f_{4}^{\gamma}=0.1\}$, $\{f_{5}^{\gamma}=-0.1\}$, $\{f_{4}^{\gamma}=0.1$ \&
$f_{5}^{\gamma}=0.1\}$, and $\{f_{4}^{Z}=0.1$ \& $f_5^{Z}=0.1\}$. For the
8~\tev\ analysis, three sample are used, with couplings $\{\ffourg=0.1\}$
(denoted TGC0), $\{\ffourg=0.1 \,\&\, \ffiveZ=0.1\}$ (denoted TGC1), and $\{
\ffourg = \ffourZ = \ffiveg = \ffiveZ = 0.1 \}$ (denoted TGC2). The 7~\tev\
samples are generated with a \formfactor\ of $\Lambda=2\tev,n=3$; the 8~\tev\
samples are generated without a \formfactor. The reweighting procedure can be
used to reweight samples generated with one choice of \formfactor\ (or no
\formfactor) to another choice of \formfactor.

\subsection{Validation of Reweighting Procedure}
\label{sec:TGC-ReweightingValidation}

To demonstrate the performance of the reweighting procedure, the 8~\tev\
\sherpa\ samples generated with \TGC s are reweighted to the \sm, and compared
to a sample generated assuming only \sm\ couplings. Additionally, the TGC1 and
TGC2 samples are reweighted to the TGC0 sample. \fig{TGC-reweight} shows the
resulting distributions of the leading \Z\ boson \pt, and the ratios of the
reweighted samples to the \sm/TGC0 distribution, separately for reweighting carried out
using the \BHO\ and the \BR\ matrix elements. For both of the codes, the
reweighted samples are seen to agree well with the directly generated samples.

\subsection{Yield Coefficients}
\label{sec:TGC-YieldCoefficients}

In order to extract limits on the \TGC s, an estimate of the number of expected
events passing the selection requirements as a function of the \TGC\ parameters
must be obtained. The expected yield is parameterised by yield coefficients \Yij,
which are obtained from the \Fij\ as:
\begin{equation}
%Y_{00} = N_{\rm expected}^{\rm SM} \; 
\Yij = \sum_{\rm events} \left( \frac{F_{ij}}{ {\rm d}\sigma_{\rm sample} } \right) 
%\cdot{N_{\rm expected}}.
\end{equation}
where ${\rm d}\sigma_{\rm sample}$ is the differential \cx\ for each event with
the parameters set to those used to generate the sample, and the sum is over
events passing the full event selection. Event-level lepton selection
efficiency, energy scale, and resolution corrections are taken into account when
calculating the yield coefficients. The yield coefficients are normalised to the
signal expectation of \powhegbox+\ggtwoZZ\ by scaling by $N_{\rm exp}^{\rm
PowhegBox+gg2ZZ}/Y_{00}$. A different set of yield coefficients is needed for
each bin of the differential distribution used to set the limits and for each
choice of form-factor. The expected yield as a function of the \TGC\ parameters
is given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:Nexp_TGC}
N_{exp} (\ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg, \ffiveZ) & = & Y_{00} + f_4^\gamma Y_{01} + f_4^Z Y_{02} + f_5^\gamma Y_{03} + f_5^Z Y_{04}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^\gamma\right)^2Y_{11} + f_4^\gamma f_4^Z Y_{12} +  f_4^\gamma f_5^\gamma Y_{13} + f_4^\gamma f_5^Z Y_{14}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^Z\right)^2Y_{22} + f_4^Zf_5^\gamma Y_{23} + f_4^Zf_5^Z Y_{24}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^\gamma\right)^2Y_{33} + f_5^\gamma f_5^Z Y_{34} \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^Z\right)^2Y_{44}
\end{eqnarray}

%coefficients for the 7~\tev\ analysis for the total number of events case with a \formfactor\

%equivalent coefficients for the 8~\tev\ analysis. In all cases, these are
%obtained from the \BR\ generator using the TGC0 sample.

\fig{TGC-yield-curves} shows the expected total event yield for the 8~\tev\
analysis as a function of the four \TGC\ parameters. In each case, the
parameters not being varied are assumed to be at their \sm\ values of zero.  The
solid blue curve shows the yields with a \formfactor\ of $n=3, \Lambda=3~\tev$;
the dashed red curve shows the yields with no \formfactor. The increase of event
yield with the strength of the coupling is reduced as a result of applying the
\formfactor.

%The yield coefficients for each bin of
%the differential distributions are shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix:tgc-coeff}.

\subsection{Limit Setting}
\label{sec:TGC-LimitSetting}

%on the number of observed events in each bin
%of the differential distributions, with systematic uncertainties introduced as
%nuisance parameters. 
The 95\% confidence level (CL) intervals for the \TGC\ parameters are determined
using a frequentist maximum profile-likelihood based method~\cite{Cowan:2010js},
combining the three \lllplp\ final states prior to the profile-likelihood
maximisation. The likelihood function is similar to that used in the \cx\
calculation, but parametrised in terms of the number of events in each bin
instead of the \cx. Systematic uncertainties are again introduced as nuisance
parameters represented as Gaussian terms ($G$). Since there are nuisance
parameters for both signal and background, the set of nuisance parameters giving
the fractional uncertainty on the signal and background expectation for a
distribution of $m$ bins is expressed as $\vec\beta = \{\beta_1, \beta_2,
\ldots, \beta_{2m}\}$, where: 
\begin{eqnarray} \text{}N_\mathrm{sig}^{i} &=&
N_\mathrm{sig}^{i\text{,nom}} \cdot (1 + \beta_i) \label{nuis1}\\ 
\text{}N_\mathrm{bkg}^i &=& N_\mathrm{bkg}^{i\text{,nom}} \cdot (1 + \beta_{i+m}) \label{nuis2}
\end{eqnarray}
%The systematics associated with the theoretical calculation of the fiducial
%\cx\ in each bin (due to PDF and scale uncertainties) are assumed to be 100\%
%correlated between bins, as are systematic uncertainties on the data-driven
%background estimate.  Bin by bin correlations of systematics on the expected
%yield due to reconstruction uncertainties are propagated for each source of
%uncertainty via the covariance matrix. 
The likelihood function is:
\begin{equation}
L(\vec{f}, \vec{\beta}) =
\prod_{i=1}^{m}P(N_\mathrm{obs}^i,\mu^i(\vec{f},\vec\beta))
\times
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^m}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\vec\beta\cdot C^{-1}\cdot\vec\beta\right)},
\label{likelihood}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{f}=\{\ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg, \ffiveZ \}$ are the \TGC\
parameters, $C$ is the covariance matrix, and $\mu^{i}$ is the expected number of events in bin $i$:
\begin{equation}
\mu^i(\vec{f},\vec{\beta})
= N_\mathrm{sig}^i(\vec{f})(1 + \beta_i) + N_\mathrm{bkg}^i(1 + \beta_{i+m}).
\end{equation}
%with:
%\begin{equation}
%N^{i}_{\rm sig}(\vec{f}) =  Y^{i}_\mathrm{\rm SM} + \sum_{j,k,V,V'} (Y_{f_j^V}\cdot
%f_j^V + Y_{f_j^Vf_i^V}\cdot (f_j^V)^2 ) 
%\right) \cdot\mathcal{L}\cdot{C_{ZZ}}.
%\end{equation}
where $N_\mathrm{sig}^i(\vec{f})$ is the expected signal yield in bin $i$ as a
function of the \TGC\ parameters, as given by~\eqn{Nexp_TGC}, but where a
separate set of yield coefficients \Yij\ must be used for each bin $i$.
%where the \Yij\ already take into account the reconstruction acceptance and are
%normalised to the integrated luminosity.

A test statistic \teststat\ is constructed as the ratio of the \maxprofilellh\
at a specific test value of the \TGC\ parameters $\vec{f}$ to the full \maxprofilellh:
\begin{equation}
\teststat =
\frac{L(N|\vec{f},\vec{\hat{\hat{\beta}}})}{L(N|\vec{\hat{f}},\vec{\hat{\beta}})}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\betahathat}$ is the value of $\vec{\beta}$ that maximises the
numerator, and $\vec{\hat{f}}$ and $\vec{\hat{\beta}}$ are the values of
$\vec{f}$ and $\vec{\beta}$ that maximise the denominator. The distribution of
\teststat\ in the assumption of \TGC s at the test value of $\vec{f}$ is
obtained by generating 10,000 pseudo experiments. In each pseudo experiment, the
nuisance parameters $\vec{\beta}$ are Gaussian fluctuated around the mean value
of $\vec{\betahathat}$ and the `observed' number of events is drawn randomly
from a Poisson distribution with a mean corresponding to the values of $\vec{f}$
and $\vec{\beta}$. The $p$-value at the test value of the \TGC\ parameters is
calculated as the fraction of pseudo-experiments which have a test statistic
smaller than the observed value of the test statistic $\teststat_{obs}$.  This
procedure is repeated scanning possible values of $\vec{f}$, and the 95\%
confidence interval is defined by all values of $\vec{f}$ for which
$p(\vec{f})\geq 5\%$. In practice, the interval is determined by starting from the best
fit value and working outwards in small steps of the parameters until the
p-value falls below 5\%.

Limits are set for one parameter at a time, holding the
other parameters at their \sm\ values of zero (termed \intro{one-dimensional
limits}), and also by varying two parameters simultaneously (\intro{two-dimensional
limits}). 
Since the sensitivity is contained in a single bin, there is effectively only a
single observable, the number of observed events in the most
sensitive bin $N_{obs}$, which is a function of the \TGC\ parameters. There
is therefore no sensitivity to the individual parameters but only to their
combination. In this therefore not possible to set a traditional `one-dimensional
limit' on a single parameter without assuming values for the others, but only to
set a limit assuming some
value for all of the other
parameters. For the `one-dimensional' limits it is assumed that the other
parameters are zero; this corresponds to the `two-dimensional' limit along the line where
the other parameter is zero.
The two-dimensional limits are extracted by first finding the best-fit point in
the two-dimensional \TGC\ parameter space, then working outwards along a radial line
from the best-fit point and including in the exclusion region all points with a
p-value $p\geq5\%$. This is repeated for 50 evenly spaced radial
lines; the 95\% confidence contour is then the ellipse connecting the set of
points which correspond to the 95\% limits on the radial spokes.

%The two-dimensional limits are extracted by first finding the best-fit value
%the two-dimensional \TGC\ parameter space, then finding one-dimensional limits along a radial line
%moving out from the best-fit value. This is repeated for 50 evenly spaced radial
%lines; the 95\% confidence contour is then the ellipse connecting the set of
%points which correspond to the 95\% limits on the radial spokes.

The expected sensitivity is obtained using pseudo-experiments. In each
pseudo-experiment, $N^{i}_{sig}$ and $N^{i}_{bg}$ are given by the \sm\
expectations but allowed to fluctuate within their uncertainties.

\section{Bin Optimisation}
\label{sec:TGC-BinOpt}

For the 7~\tev\ analysis, limits were set 
%using the total number of observed events, and by 
using the number of events observed in bins of the leading \Z\
boson candidate \pt\ and in bins of the mass of the four-lepton system. It was found that
binning in the leading \Z\ boson \pt\ yielded the most stringent expected limits, and
that the tightest expected limits were obtained using four bins of \pt\ with boundaries 0-60,
60-100, 100-200 and $>$ 200~\GeV. A combined fit with the results of a \ZZllvv\
analysis was also carried out, using three bins of the \pt\ of the leptonically decaying \Z\
candidate in the \ZZllvv\ events.

For the 8~\tev\ analysis, a further bin optimisation was carried out, varying
the number of bins and the bin boundaries. For each variation, a set of 5,000
pseudo-experiments is carried out in order to derive the expected limit. The
expected signal in each bin is re-calculated from \mc, and the reconstruction
systematic uncertainties re-evaluated, as well as the theoretical uncertainties on
the differential \cx. The irreducible background estimate in each bin is derived from the
\mc. An estimate for the reducible background in each bin is obtained by dividing the total
data-driven reducible background estimate according to the background shape obtained from data. The
fractional systematic and statistical uncertainties on the data-driven background
estimate are assumed to be the same in every bin. No systematic to
account for uncertainties on the reducible background shape is assigned. This
approximation is justified by the fact that the total background uncertainty is
already large, and that the background contribution when the leading \Z\ boson has
\pt\ above 100~\gev\ is very small.

This procedure means that large statistical and systematic uncertainties on the
expected signal and large PDF and scale errors on the fiducial \cx\ when the
lower boundary of the last bin is set very high are taken into account in the
expected limits. It does not take into account the fact that there may be
insufficient \mc\ statistics to properly estimate the reconstruction systematic
uncertainties in the last bin. Therefore before choosing a final binning it is
checked that the statistics in the last bin are sufficient to properly evaluate
the systematics.

A variety of choices of binning were tried, varying the number of bins from one
to five, and varying the boundaries of the bins. It is observed that the
expected limits are most sensitive to the choice of the lower boundary of the last bin, which
is taken to be inclusive (i.e. including all events with \Z\ boson \pt\ greater
than the lower bin boundary). The limits are not observed to be very sensitive
to the number of bins, or to the boundaries of the bins other than the last.
\fig{TGC-binOpt} shows the expected limit on \ffourg\ as a function of the lower
boundary of the last bin. Limits obtained using different numbers of bins are
shown as different coloured markers. The expected limits become more stringent
as the lower boundary of the last bin increases in \pt, but varying the bin boundaries
other than the lower boundary of the last bin has little effect on the expected
limits.  The tightening of the limits as the boundary of the last bin is
increased is because the relative increase in signal yield due to the existence
of \TGC s is much larger at higher \Z\ boson \pt. It is seen that beyond
300~\gev\ the limits do not significantly improve, since past this point the
signal expectation in the case of \sm\ couplings only becomes very small, and so
increasing the bin boundary further does little to increase the significance of
the \TGC\ signal. Beyond 550~\gev, the expected limits worsen; this is because
the statistical, systematic, and theoretical uncertainties on the expected
signal become very large, as can be seen in~\fig{TGC-uncertainties} which shows
the percentage uncertainty from different sources, for a variety of choices of
binning.
%due to the signal and background statistical and
%systematic uncertainties, and from theoretical uncertainties on the fiducial
%\cx, for a variety of choices of binning.
%Full details of the different bin boundaries tried
%are given in~\app{}.

The final limits are set using two bins of leading \Z\ boson \pt: 0-300 and
${>300}$~\gev. This binning was chosen as it gives similar limits to choices of
binning where the last bin boundary is higher in \pt, but retains sufficient
statistics in the signal \mc\ in order to estimate the systematic uncertainties.
Increasing the number of bins was not seen to give any improvement in the
expected limits, so for computational convenience the binning with the lowest
number of bins was chosen.

\section{Robustness of Limits}
\label{sec:TGC-Robustness}

In order to check the robustness of the limits, the expected limits obtained
using the \BR\ matrix-elements to determine the yield coefficients are compared with
expected limits obtained using \BHO\ matrix-elements to determine the coefficients.
Similarly, the expected limits obtained using samples generated with different
values of the \TGC\ parameters are compared (e.g. the TGC0 sample is compared to the TGC1
sample). Full details of the comparison are given
in~\app{TGC-Robustness}; the changes in expected limits are smaller
than the statistical uncertainties on the limit.

In order to check the effect of the assumption that the fractional statistical and
systematic uncertainties on the
data-driven reducible background estimate are the same in each bin of leading \Z\
boson \pt, expected limits are obtained with the data-driven background
uncertainties increased by a factor of five. The resulting changes in the
expected limits are less than 1\%, confirming the assumption that the effect of the
reducible background uncertainty on the sensitivity is small. Treating the
background systematic uncertainty as uncorrelated between bins leads to a
negligible ($<0.1\%$) worsening in the limits.

\section{Expected and Observed Limits}
\label{sec:TGC-ExpObsLimits}

\fig{tgc-nicePlot} shows expected and observed distributions of the \pt\ of the
leading \Z\ candidate with the binning used to set the \TGC\ limits, along with
expected distributions in the case of \TGC s, with parameters set close to
previously obtained experimental limits.

expected 95\% confidence interval limits obtained using the 7~\tev\ and the
8~\tev\ data, respectively. The limit on each coupling assumes that the other
couplings are fixed at their \sm\ value of zero. In both datasets, the best fit
value for all of the couplings are consistent with zero, and the observed limits are consistent with the expected
limits. The expected limits from the 8~\tev\ data are 2.4-3.0 times more
stringent than the expected limits from the 7~\tev\ data using both the
\ZZllll\ and \ZZllvv\ channels, or 3.0-3.6 times more stringent than the
expected limits from the 7~\tev\ data using only the \ZZllll\ channel.

\fig{TGC-limits-2D} shows `two-dimensional' 95\% confidence level limits,

fixed at their \sm\ value of zero. 

%The horizontal and vertical lines

A comparison of the one-dimensional limits presented here and those derived from
measurements at at other experiments is shown in~\fig{TGC-SummaryPlot}. The
limits are more stringent than those derived from measurements at
LEP~\cite{bib:LEPEW2006} and the Tevatron~\cite{Abazov:2007ad}.
%and previously by ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS_ZZ4l:1fb2011}. 
The ATLAS \sqrtseq{7} limits are comparable to the limits from
CMS~\cite{CMS:2012rg}, derived at the same centre-of-mass energy using a
similarly sized dataset. It should be noted that the limits from LEP and CMS do
not use a form factor, and those from the Tevatron use $\Lambda = 1.2\TeV$.  The
8~\tev\ limits presented here are significantly tighter than any previous
limits.
