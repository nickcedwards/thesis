\section{Limit Setting Procedure}

\subsection{Matrix Element Reweighting}
As described in~\sec{TheoryZZ-TGCs}, anomalous neutral triple gauge couplings affecting \ZZ\
production are described by four parameters, \ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg\ and
\ffiveZ.
Since the parameters enter linearly in the effective Lagrangian
(\eqn{tgc-lagrangian}), they will appear
quadratically in the amplitude of the \ZZllll\ process. The differential \cx\
can thus be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:dsigma}
{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC} & = & F_{00} + f_4^\gamma F_{01} + f_4^Z F_{02} + f_5^\gamma F_{03} + f_5^Z F_{04}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^\gamma\right)^2F_{11} + f_4^\gamma f_4^Z F_{12} +  f_4^\gamma f_5^\gamma F_{13} + f_4^\gamma f_5^Z F_{14}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_4^Z\right)^2F_{22} + f_4^Zf_5^\gamma F_{23} + f_4^Zf_5^Z F_{24}  \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^\gamma\right)^2F_{33} + f_5^\gamma f_5^Z F_{34} \nonumber \\
&+& \left(f_5^Z\right)^2F_{44}
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{ij}$ are coefficients describing how the \cx\ changes in the presence
of \TGC s. A priori, there are 25 coefficients, however, using the 
symmetry property of the coefficients ($F_{ij}=F_{ji}$), it is seen 
that only $25-10=15$ are independent. $F_{00}$ corresponds to the contribution
of the \sm\ diagrams and the rest consist of operator contributions associated with the
anomalous couplings. 

A simulated event generated assuming only \sm\ couplings can be assigned a weight corresponding to the differential \cx\
assuming \TGC\ couplings at some specific value of the four parameters:
\begin{equation}
{\rm weight} = \frac{{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC}(\ffourg, \ffourZ, \ffiveg,
\ffiveZ)}{{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM}}
\end{equation}
By assigning such a weight to every event in the sample, it is possible to reweight a sample
generated with only \sm\ couplings to a sample with \TGC\ couplings.
This procedure can be easily extended to reweight a sample generated assuming
any given set of \TGC s to any other set of \TGC s. For example, to reweight a sample
generated assuming only \sm\ couplings to sample assuming \ffourg=0.1, one would
apply to each event a weight:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{revisit}
{\rm weight} = \frac{F_{00} + 0.1 \cdot  F_{01} + (0.1)^{2} \cdot
F_{11}}{F_{00}}
\end{eqnarray}
The \Fij\ coefficients are completely
specified by the kinematics of the incoming and outgoing particles, and so must
be evaluated on an event by event basis. They are
independent of the values of the anomalous coupling parameters, although they do depend on
the choice of \formfactor. The coefficients are determined using matrix elements for
\ZZllll\ production in the presence of \TGC s. By using Equation~\ref{eqn:dsigma} it 
is possible to write down 15 equations that uniquely determine the 
coefficients $F_{ij}$ in terms of matrix elements assuming particular values
for the TGC couplings.
To illustrate the procedure, consider the simplified situation where 
there is just one coupling constant $f$. In this case, there are 3 coefficients 
to be determined:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{revisit2}
{\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM+TGC} = F_0 + fF_1 + f^2F_2 
\end{eqnarray}
where  $F_0={\rm d}\sigma_{\rm SM}$.

Using three different values of $f$, e.g $f=\{0,1,-1\}$, three independent
equations may be written down:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{matrix1}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
{\rm d}\sigma_1\\
{\rm d}\sigma_2\\
{\rm d}\sigma_3
\end{array}\right) =
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\left(\begin{array}{c}
F_0\\
F_1\\
F_2
\end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
Denoting the matrix containing the coupling values $\hat{A}$, the cross sections
d$\vec{\sigma}$ and the coefficients $\vec{F}$, the equations are easily
manipulated to give the coefficients 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{matrix2} {\rm
d}\vec{\sigma}=\hat{A}\vec{F} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \vec{F}=\hat{A}^{-1}{\rm
d}\vec{\sigma} 
\end{eqnarray} 
Clearly, $\hat{A}$ must be invertible. This is the
case if the couplings are chosen such that the three equations in~\ref{matrix1}
are independent. When considering all four couplings at the same time, the
matrix $\hat{A}$ is 15$\times$15 and ${\rm d}\vec{\sigma}$ and $\vec{F}$ are
15-dimensional vectors.

The TGC matrix elements are obtained from the next-to-leading order \mc\
generator BHO~\cite{bho}. Matrix elements from the leading-order Baur-Rainwater
MC generator~\cite{Baur:1994au} are also used as a cross-check. The matrix
elements are introduced into the \AfterBurner\ framework~\cite{Bella:2008wc},
which enables a calculation of the amplitude given the four-vectors and PDG
codes of the incoming partons and outgoing particles from the hard process. 

Whilst it is possible to reweight a \sm\ sample to a TGC point, this suffers
from a lack of statistics in the tails of distributions such as the \pt\ of the
\Z\ bosons and the four-lepton invariant mass, where the presence of TGCs
enhances the cross section at high momentum and high invariant mass. Instead,
samples generated with values of the TGC couplings set near previously set
experimental limits are used; this ensures statistics in the tails of the
distributions. The \powhegbox\ and \ggZZ\ generators used to generate the nominal signal
samples do not model \TGC s; instead the samples are generated using \sherpa,
which does. For the 7~\tev\ analysis, four samples are used, with couplings
... For the 8~\tev\ analysis, three sample are used. The 7~\tev\ samples are
generated with a \formfactor of $\Lambda=2\tev,n=3$; the 8~\tev\ samples are
generated without a \formfactor. The reweighting procedure can of course be used to
reweight samples generated with one \formfactor (or no \formfactor) to another
\formfactor.

\subsection{Validation of Reweighting Procedure}

To demonstrate the performance of the reweighting procedure, the \sherpa\
samples gnerated with \TGC s are reweighted to the \sm\ (i.e. no \TGC s), and
compared to a sample generated with only \sm\ couplings. \fig{} shows the
resulting distributions of the \pt\ of the leading \Z\ boson, and the ratios of
the reweighted samples to the \sm\ distribution; the reweighted samples are seen
to agree well with the \sm\ sample.

\subsection{Yield Coefficients}

In order to extract limits on the \TGC s, the number of expected events as a
function of the \TGC\ couplings must be predicted. This is paramaterised by
yield coefficients \Yij, which may be obtained trivially from the \Fij\ as:
\begin{equation}
\Yij = F_{ij}/F_{00}\cdot{N_{\rm expected}}.
\end{equation}
where $N_{\rm expected}$ is the \sm\ number of expected events.
