\chapter{Object Reconstruction}

In this chapter the software algorithms used to reconstruct and identify
different particles are described. Reconstruction involves reconstructing tracks in the
Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer, identifying interaction vertices,
and identifying clusters of energy deposits in the calorimeter systems. These are
then combined to reconstruct particles such as electrons, muons, jets, photons,
tau leptons, as well as to measure properties as the event such as missing
transverse energy. 
Since triggering on electrons and muons is a crucial component of the
measurements described in this thesis, this is described in more detail here.

~\fig{particle-flow} shows schematically how different particles interect with
the different detector components. Muons leave a track in the Inner Detector,
typically deposit little in the calorimeters and then leave a track in the Muon
Spectrometer. Photons leave no track in the inner detector, and will typically
deposit all of their energy in the EM calorimeter, leaving an electromagtic
shower. Electrons also typically deposit all of their energy in the EM
calorimeter, but will also leave a track in the Inner Detector.
Charged hadrons such as protons leave a track in the Inner Detector, 
deposit minimal amounts of energy in the EM calorimeter, but then deposit
most of their energy in the hadronic calorimeter, leaving a long wide shower.
Neutral hadrons such as neutrons behave in a similar manner to charged hadrons,
but do not leave an Inner Detctor track. Neutrinos completely escape the
detector leaving no trace in any of the detectors systems.
