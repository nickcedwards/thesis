\chapter{Particle Reconstruction}
\label{chap:Reconstruction}

In this chapter the software algorithms used to reconstruct and identify
different particles are described. The first step in particle reconstruction
involves reconstructing tracks in the \id\ and the \ms,
identifying interaction vertices, and identifying clusters of energy deposits in
the calorimeter systems. These are then combined to reconstruct particles such
as electrons, muons, jets, photons, and tau leptons, as well as to measure
properties of the event such as missing transverse energy.  Since triggering on
electrons and muons is a crucial component of the measurements described in this
thesis, this is also described in more detail here.

~\fig{particle-flow} shows schematically how different types of particle interact with
the different detector components. Muons leave a track in the \id,
typically deposit little energy in the calorimeters and then leave a track in the Muon
Spectrometer. Photons leave no track in the inner detector, and will typically
deposit all of their energy in the EM calorimeter, leaving an electromagnetic
shower. Electrons also typically deposit all of their energy in the EM
calorimeter, but will also leave a track in the \id.
Charged hadrons such as protons leave a track in the \id, 
deposit minimal amounts of energy in the EM calorimeter, and then deposit
most of their energy in the hadronic calorimeter, leaving a long wide shower.
Neutral hadrons such as neutrons behave in a similar manner to charged hadrons,
but do not leave an \id\ track. Neutrinos completely escape the
detector leaving no trace in any of the detectors systems.
