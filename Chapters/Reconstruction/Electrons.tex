Electrons are reconstructed in the central region (\modetalt{2.5}) by a
combination of a calorimeter cluster and an inner detector track; this is
referred to below as the `standard' electron algorithm. Reconstruction begins
with the construction of seed clusters in the calorimeter. These are formed from
calorimeter towers of size \deltaetadeltaphi{0.025}{0.025}, corresonding to the
size of cells in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter. This
results in a grid of $200 \times 256$ towers The energy
of the tower is the sum of all the EM calorimeter cells in all three layers
falling within the tower. Where cells are shared between more than one tower the
energy is shared according teh the fractional overlap of the cell with each
tower. The seed cells are formed by identifying local energy maxima in a sliding window of
