\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model of particle physics is a gauge theory describing the
fundamental components of matter and their interactions, and encompasses our
current understanding of the world at particle level. The Standard Model was
formulated in the 1970s, and since then has been tested to an unprecidented
level of precision. %SOME REFERENCES FOR THIS
