\section{The ATLAS Detector}

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is one of two general purpose particle-physics
detectors at the LHC, built to study both particle-particle and ion-ion
interactions. The high centre of mass energy and high luminosity of LHC proton-proton collisions
allows the study of physics at the \tev scale for the first time, as well as
precision measurements of the Standard Model. ATLAS has been designed to be
capable of a wide range of measurements, including (but by no means limited to)
high precision tests of QCD, electroweak interactions, and flavour physics, searching for and measuring
the properties of the Higgs Boson, searches for supersymmetery, measurements
of the properties of the top-quark, searches for new vector bosons and searches
for extra-dimensions. The extremely high luminosity also presents challenges which
the detector has been designed to overcome. At design luminosity, $10^9$
inelastic collisions occur per second, which results in multiple events, on average ?? in 2012 running, occuring
simultaneously. The detector has been designed to cope with these high
`pileu-up' conditions. Many of the physics processes of interested occur at very
small rates with respect to extremelly high QCD background rates. The detector
must therfore allow processes of interest to be distinguished from the
background.

A cut-away view of the ATLAS detector~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003} is shown in~\fig{atlas-det-1}. The detector consists
of an inner tracking detector surrounding the interaction point, which is
surrounded by electromagnetic and hardonic calorimeters and finally a muon
spectrometer. A three-level trigger system is used to select events to read out.
These sub-systems are described in more detail in the following
sections.

\subsection{ATLAS Co-ordinate System}
ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
interaction point in the centre of the detector. The 
the $z$-axis points along the beam-pipe, the $x$-axis towards the 
centre of the LHC ring, and the $y$-axis upwards. Particle directions and
detector element positions are generally described by their azimuthal angle
$\phi$ and their  pseudorapidity $\eta$. The azimuthal angle describes the angle
in the $x-y$ plane, with $\phi=0$ along the $x$ axis, increasing clockwise
around the beam-pipe.
The pseudorapidity $\eta$ is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ (the
angle in the $x-z$ plane) as$\eta = - \ln\tan(\theta/2)$, and is an
approximation to rapidity in the high energy limit.
The radial co-ordinate $r$ measures the radial distance from the interaction
point. 

\subsection{Inner Detector}

\subsubsection{Pixel Detector}
\subsubsection{Semiconductor Tracker (SCT)}

\label{sec:Detector-SCT}

The Atlas Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT) is one of three components of the experiment's Inner Detector (ID). The SCT is a silicon strip detector, designed to reconstruct the tracks of passing charged particles. The SCT consists of 4 barrels surrounding the beam pipe and two end-caps consisting of 9 disks each. The barrels consist of 2112 separate modules and extend from a radius of 299mm from the beam line at the innermost barrel to a radius of 514mm at the outermost. The barrels are numbered from 3 to 6. Each endcap consists of 988 modules arranged in such a way that a particle must pass through four layers of the detector.

The SCT modules are made from two pairs of single sided p-in-n silicon chips biased at 150V. Charged particles passing through the depletion region at the centre of the junction produce electron hole pairs. These are swept apart by the bias voltage. The electrons are then collected on the top of the chip, producing a signal which can be read out. Each pair of chips is wire-bonded together and two pairs are glued together to form a two sided module.
