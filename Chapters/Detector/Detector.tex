\section{The Large Hadron Collider}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator located at CERN, the
European Organisation for Nuclear Research, on the French-Swiss border near
Geneva. The LHC is the world's most powerful particle accelerator, colliding beams of
protons together at centre of mass energies of up to 8 \TeV, with the aim of
better understanding the workings of our Universe. It is installed in
tunnel of circumference 26.7 km, which previously held the Large
Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), and is between 45 and 170 m below the ground.
The beams are brought to collisions at four points around the ring, at each of
which a different experiment is located. The machine is also capable of colliding heavy ions, providing a complimentary heavy-ion physics program.

The design of the LHC is described in detail in ~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001}
and ~\cite{Brüning:782076}. A brief summary is given in~\ref{sec-lhc-design},
and details of LHC operations in 2011 and 2012 are given
in~\ref{sec-lhc-operation}.

\subsection{Machine Design}
\label{sec-lhc-design}

The LHC consists of two counter-circulating beams of protons. 
Since the beams are of similarly charged particles
orbiting in opposite directions, they require opposite bending fields, thus need
to be in separate beam-pipes. Due to space constraints, the two beam-pipes are
contained within a single structure incorporating a twin bore superconducting
magnet. Superconducting dipole magnets are
used to bend the beams and keep them in orbit and superconducting quadrapole magnets are used to
keep the beams focussed. The magnets must be cooled to 2K to retain their superconducting
properties; this is achieved with a helium based cooling system. 

Protons are injected into the LHC from the SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) in
bunches, at a centre of mass energy of 450 \GeV. They are then accelerated to the desired
collision energy by means of superconducting Radio Frequency (RF) cavities. Once the
particles are accelerated to full energy, the RF cavities are used to keep the
particles in their bunches. The bunches are brought to collision at four points
around the ring, at each of which a different experiment is located. ATLAS sits at
point 1, the ALICE experiment at Point 2, the CMS experiment at Point 5, and the
LHCb experiment at Point 8 (the remaining `Points' are access locations to the
ring).

The rate at which collisions occur depends on the instantaneous luminosity
$\mathcal{L}$ and the collision cross-section $\sigma$, related by:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt} = \mathcal{L} \cdot \sigma
\end{equation}

The total cross-section for
proton-proton collisions at the LHC has been measured to be
\measStatSyst{98.3}{\errSym{0.2}}{\errSym{2.8}}~mb\footnote{$1 \rm{b} = 10^{-28}
m^{2}$} at a centre of mass energy of 7 \tev~\cite{0295-5075-96-2-21002}, thus
at the LHC design luminosity of $1 \times 10^{34}~\rm{cm}^{-2}\rm{s}^{-1}$
collisions will occur at a rate of approximately 100 MHz. 

The rate at which a particular
physics process occurs depends on the cross section for the process in question.
Since many of the physics processes under study at the LHC are very rare and
have small cross-sections, it is important to maximise the luminosity as much as
possible. The instantaneous luminosity is approximately given by:
%(neglecting relativistic effects for clarity):

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{N_{\rm{b}}^{2}n_{\rm{b}}f_{\rm{rev}}\gamma_{\rm{r}}}{4\pi
\epsilon_{n}\beta^{*} F}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_{\rm{b}}$ is the number of particles per bunch,
    \item $n_{\rm{b}}$ is the number of bunches per beam, 
    \item $f_{\rm{rev}}$ is the revolution frequency, 
    \item $F$ is a geometric function to account for the crossing angle between the beams (since
they are generally not collided head on), 
    \item $\epsilon_{n}$ is the beam emittance,
a measure of how uniform the momentum of particles in the beam is or how small
the beam can be `squeezed',
    \item $\beta^{*}$ is a measure of how narrow the beam is at the interaction
    point, or how `squeezed' it is,
    \item $\gamma_{r}$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor $(1 - v^2/c^2)-{1/2}$.
\end{itemize}
    
The cross-section of the beam at
the interaction point is proportional to ${\epsilon_{n} \cdot \beta^{*}}$.
The instantaneous luminosity can be maximised by increasing the
number of particles per bunch, decreasing the bunch spacing (or equivalently
increasing the number of bunches per beam) or decreasing the size of the bunch
at the interaction point by decreasing $\epsilon_{n}$ and $\beta^{*}$.

A measure of how many collisions have occurred is the integrated luminosity:

\begin{equation}
L = \int \mathcal{L} \, dt
\end{equation}

The number of events occurring for a given process with cross-section
$\sigma_{\rm{process}}$ in a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity $L$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
N_{\rm{process}} = L \cdot \sigma_{\rm{process}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{LHC Operation in 2011 and 2012}
\label{sec-lhc-operation}

The LHC began operation in November 2009 with collisions at a centre of mass
energy of 900~\GeV, with the centre of mass energy raising to a world record
2.36~\TeV\ by the end of the year. In 2010 the centre of mass energy was
successfully increased to 7~\TeV. Over 2010 and 2011 the LHC continued to run at
\sqrts{7}, with the instantaneous luminosity steadily increasing. In 2010 the
LHC delivered \LumiTotalDeliveredTwentyTen\ of integrated luminosity to ATLAS
and delivered \LumiTotalDeliveredTwentyEleven\ in 2011. In 2012 the centre of mass energy was
increased to 8 \tev, and the instantaneous luminosity further increased by
increasing the number of particles per bunch slightly and decreasing
$\epsilon_{n}$ and $\beta^{*}$, leading to a total integrated luminosity
delivered to ATLAS in 2012 of \LumiTotalDeliveredTwentyTwelve.

\section{The ATLAS Detector}

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is one of two general purpose particle-physics
detectors at the LHC, built to study both proton-proton and ion-ion
interactions. The high centre of mass energy and high luminosity of LHC proton-proton collisions
allows the study of physics at the \tev\ scale for the first time, as well as
precision measurements of the Standard Model. ATLAS has been designed to be
capable of a wide range of measurements, including (but by no means limited to):
high precision tests of QCD, electroweak interactions, and flavour physics; searching for and measuring
the properties of the Higgs Boson; searches for supersymmetery; measurements
of the properties of the top-quark; searches for new vector bosons and searches
for extra-dimensions. 

The extremely high luminosity presents challenges which
the detector has been designed to overcome. At design luminosity, $10^9$
inelastic collisions occur per second, which results in multiple interactions, up to
\PeakIntPerBunchCrossing\ in 2012 running, occurring
simultaneously. The detector has been designed to cope with these high
`pile-up' conditions, as well as be capable of operating in the high radiation
environment arising from the high luminosity. Many of the physics processes of interested occur at very
small rates with respect to extremely high QCD background rates. The detector
must therefore allow processes of interest to be distinguished from the
background. To meet these challenges, ATLAS was defined with the following
criteria in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fast, radiation hard electronics and sensors.
\item High granularity to  cope with high particle fluxes and overlapping events.
\item Full azimuthal coverage to allow for missing transverse energy
measurement, and large acceptance in pseudo-rapidity.
\item Precision tracking to provide good charged particle momentum resolution
and reconstruction efficiency, and to allow observation of secondary vertices to
identify $b$-hadrons and $\tau$-leptons.
\item Excellent electromagnetic calorimetry for electron and photon
identification.
\item Full-coverage hadronic calorimetry for accurate jet and missing transverse
energy measurements.
\item Good muon identification, momentum resolution and charge determination over a wide range of
momentum.
\item Efficient triggering on low transverse-momentum object with sufficient
background rejection.
\end{itemize}

The main performance goals are given in~\tab{perf-goals}.

\end{table}

A cut-away view of the ATLAS detector~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003} is shown in~\fig{atlas-det-1}. The detector consists
of an inner tracking detector, which is
surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and finally a muon
spectrometer. The inner detector is immersed in a 2 T solenoidal field to allow
for momentum measurement. The muon spectrometer is also immersed in a magnetic
field, provided by an air-core toroid system  which generates strong
bending power over a large volume with a minimum of material, thus
minimising multiple-scattering effects. A three-level trigger system is used to select events to read out.
These sub-systems are described in more detail in the following
sections.

\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS detector~\cite{Jean-Luc:841458}. The
various detector sub-systems are labelled.}
\label{fig:atlas-det-1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ATLAS Co-ordinate System}
ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
interaction point in the centre of the detector. The 
the \z-axis points along the beam-pipe, the \x-axis towards the 
centre of the LHC ring, and the \y-axis upwards. Particle directions and
detector element positions are generally described by their azimuthal angle
$\phi$ and their pseudorapidity $\eta$. The azimuthal angle describes the angle
in the \x-\y plane, with $\phi=0$ along the \x axis, increasing clockwise
around the beam-pipe.
The pseudorapidity $\eta$ is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ (the
angle in the $x-z$ plane) as $\eta = - \ln\tan(\theta/2)$, and is an
approximation to rapidity in the high energy limit.
The radial co-ordinate \R\ measures the radial distance from the interaction
point. 

\subsection{Inner Detector}

The ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) is located closest to the beam pipe. It is a tracking
detector designed to provide hermetic and robust pattern recognition, locate
interaction vertices, including displaced secondary vertices from long-lived
particles, and provide a precise measurement of the transverse momenta of charged
particles with a nominal \pt\ threshold of 0.5 GeV. The Inner Detector consists
of a silicon pixel detector (the ``Pixel Detector'', a silicon strip detector (the ``Semiconductor
Tracker'' or SCT) and a transition radiation tracker (the TRT), located within a
2 T magnetic field provided by a solenoidal superconducting magnet.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Cut-away view of the Inner Detector, taken from~\cite{Aad:1125884}.}
\label{fig:id-1}
\end{figure}

A cut-away diagram of the Inner Detector is shown in \fig{id-1}. The detector
is cylindrical in shape, extending 3512 mm either side of the interaction point
in the \z\ direction with a radius of 1150 mm. The subdetectors all consist of
concentric cylindrical layers surrounding the beam pipe, referred to as
`barrels', with disks referred to as `end caps' covering each end of the
barrels. A plan view of a quarter of the Inner Detector is shown
in~\fig{id-plan}. The Pixel and SCT detectors provide coverage up to $|\eta|<2.5$,
with the TRT enhancing pattern recognition and track momentum resolution up to
$|\eta|<2.0$

positions and pseudo-rapidity coverage of the various subdetectors. Figure taken from~\cite{Aad:1125884}.}
\label{fig:id-plan}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Pixel Detector}

The pixel detector is the detector component closest to the beam. It is formed
of layers of silicon semiconducting pixels, and is designed to have a very
high granularity for resolving primary and secondary interaction vertices. There
are three barrel layers closed by an endcap consisting of three disks at each
end. The barrels are numbered from 0 to 2. The closest layer to the beam
pipe, termed the \b-layer (due to it's important role in detecting secondary
vertices for \b\ physics), is
positioned at a radius of 50.5 mm. Due to the high radiation dose that it will receive at this position, it will need to be replaced after three years
operation at design luminosity.

The detector layers are formed of sensor modules. Each module consists of a 250 \micro m thick
silicons sensor consisting of 46,080 active pixels. There are a total of 1,744
modules, all with identical dimensions of $19\times400~\mu \rm{m}^{2}$. In total
there are approximately $80.4\times 10^{6}$ readout channels.

Typically particles will traverse three layers of the detector, in most case
producing three space-points. The intrinsic accuracy of the position
measurement is 10\micro m in $(\rm{R}-\phi)$ and 155 \micro m in \z\ in the
barrel layers and 10\micro m in $(\rm{R}-\phi)$ and 155 \micro m in $\phi$ in
the endcaps.

\subsubsection{Semiconductor Tracker (SCT)}

\label{sec:Detector-SCT}

The SCT is a silicon strip detector, consisting of four barrels and two end-caps
consisting of nine disks each. The barrels consist of 2112 separate modules and
extend from a radius of 299 mm from the beam line at the innermost barrel to a
radius of 514 mm at the outermost. The barrels are numbered from 3 to 6. Each
endcap consists of 988 modules, arranged in such a way that a particle must pass
through four layers of the detector.

%SCT modules are made from two pairs of single sided p-in-n silicon chips biased
SCT modules are made from two layers of single sided p-in-n silicon chips biased
at 150V (this voltage will increase as the detector become radiation damaged). Charged particles passing through the depletion region at the centre of
the junction produce electron hole pairs, which are swept apart by the bias
voltage. The electrons are then collected on the top of the chip, producing a
signal which can be read out. A photo of an SCT barrel module is shown
in~\fig{sct-barrel-module}.

Each side of the module consists of 768 strips,
with a pitch of 80 \micro m for barrel modules, and an average pitch of 80
\micro m for endcap modules. The strips are 6.4~cm long, and run parallel to the
beam axis on the barrel, and along the \R\ direction on the endcap. In total
there are approximately $6.3 \times 10^{6}$ readout channels.

\caption{Photograph of an SCT barrel module.}
\label{fig:sct-barrel-module}
\end{figure}

%Each pair of chips is wire-bonded together and two
%pairs 
The two layers are glued together at a stereo angle of 40~mrad to form a two sided
module. The readout is of a binary form, with a charge collection threshold of 1
fC (chosen to maximise efficiency and minimise noise). To form a space-point, a
coincidence of hits on either side of the module is required. The stereo
angle gives the ability to determine where along the strip the hit occurred,
giving resolution in \z\ (\R) in the barrels (endcaps). A small angle is used to
prevent ambiguities in the presence of multiple nearby hits. The spatial
resolution of the detector is 17 \micro m in ($\rm{R}-\phi$) and 580 \micro m in
\z\ (in the barrel) or \R\ (in the endcaps).

\subsubsection{Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT)}
\label{sec:Detector-TRT}

The Transition Radiation Tracker is a straw drift tube tracker, with additional
particle identification capabilities from transition radiation. It consists of
modules formed from bundles of 4 mm diameter straws, filled with
$\rm{XeCO_{2}O_{2}}$ gas. A tungsten wire of 30 \micro m diameter runs down
the centre of the tube to collect charge. In the barrel the straws run parallel
with the beam axis and are 144 cm long. The wires are electrically divided into two halves at
\modetaeq{0} and read out at either end (this subdivision leads to an
inefficiency along a length of approximately 2 cm at the centre of the TRT). In
the endcaps the straws are 37 cm long and run radially. In total there are
351,000 readout channels.

% Number of hits - resolution - advantages of continuos tracking
All charged tracks with \ptgt{0.5} and \modetalt{0.2} will traverse at least 36
straws, except in the barrel to endcap transition region (\modetabetween{0.8}{1.0})
where only 22 straws will be traversed. The ($R-\phi$) resolution is 130 \micro
m. Despite the low resolution compared to the silicon trackers, and the lack of
a measurement in the \z\ direction, the hits in the TRT contribute significantly
to the pattern recognition and momentum resolution due to the large number of
measurements and longer measured track length.

% TR
The barrel straws are embedded in a matrix of 19 \micro m diameter polypropylene
fibres, and the endcap disk layers are sandwiched between 15 \micro m
polypropylene foils. When charged particles cross these boundaries they emit
transition radiation photons. These photons are then absorbed in the Xenon gas
mixture, and produce much larger signals than minimum-ionising
charged particles. The energy of the transition radiation photons depends
heavily on particle type, and is approximately 200 keV for a 20 GeV electron and
1 keV for a 20 GeV pion. This difference can be exploited for particle
identification, by counting the number of hits over a higher threshold.
Electrons with \ptgt{2} typically produce 7 - 10 high threshold hits, whereas
pions and other charged particles will produce far fewer.

\subsection{Calorimetry}

Sitting outside the inner detector and its magnetic field are the ATLAS
calorimeter systems. The purpose of the calorimeter is to measure the energy and
position of particles. A particle entering the calorimeter will produce a
`shower' of secondary particles. The energy of this shower is then measured.
ATLAS uses sampling calorimeter, in which different materials, sandwiched
together in layers, are used for the absorption and the energy measurement. This
allows for a more compact design and hence better shower containment. Position
measurement is obtained by segmenting the calorimeter in the \z\ and $\phi$
directions.

Different absorbers are required depending on whether the particle interacts
electromagnetically or strongly, and the properties of the showers that develop
are different. The ATLAS calorimeters are divided into two distinct subsystems,
the Electromagnetic calorimeter and the Hadronic calorimeter. An Electromagnetic
shower consists of electrons and photons, and is normally fully contained in the
calorimeter; thus it can be fully detected. Hadronic showers involved many more
particles types, including muons and neutrinos which escape detection, and tend
to be longer and wider, often spilling out of the calorimeter. The full energy
of the shower is thus not fully detected, and so a calibration of the energy
response is required. It is important for the calorimeter to provide good
containment for electromagnetic and hadronic showers, not only for the purposes
of energy measurement, but also to allow a good missing transverse energy
requirement, and to prevent punch-through into the muon system.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{{0803015_01}.jpg}
\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS calorimeter system. Image taken
from~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003}.}
\label{fig:calo-cutaway}
\end{figure}

A cutaway view showing the location of the various calorimeter elements is shown
in~\fig{calo-cutaway}. The calorimeters cover the range \modetalt{4.9}. Over the
$\eta$ range of the inner-detector, the Electromagnetic calorimeter gives fine
granularity to allow precise measurement of electrons and photons. The Hadronic
calorimeter is more coarsely segmented, but is sufficient to meet the
requirements of jet and missing transverse energy measurement.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeters}

The electromagnetic calorimeter (also referred to as the {\it LAr}) uses liquid
argon as the active detector material, and lead as an absorber. Incident
particles ionise atoms in the lead absorber, creating an electromagnetic shower.
Charged particles in the shower ionise the liquid argon, where the electrons
drift to copper electrodes in the presence of an electric field.

The calorimeter consists of two half barrels extending to \modetalt{1.475} (with
a 4~mm gap at \z\ = 0) and two coaxial wheels on each side, the first covering
\modetabetween{1.375}{2.5} and the second covering \modetabetween{2.5}{3.2}.
Additional material needed to instrument and cool the detector creates a `crack'
region at \modetabetween{1.375}{1.52}, where the energy resolution is
significantly degraded.

The barrel calorimeter has an accordion structure in order to avoid azimuthal
cracks and to provide full $\phi$ symmetry, as shown in
figure~\fig{lar-diagram}. The accordion structure is made of
the lead absorber, with the liquid argon filling the 2.11 mm gaps between the
absorbers. The barrel of the LAr calorimeter is divided into three layers, with
different cell granularity. The first layer is divided into cells of 
\deltaetadeltaphi{0.0031}{0.098}. The fine granularity in $\eta$ of this layer
is used to determine the pseudo-rapidity of the particle, and for measurements
of the shower shape, an important input to particle identification. The
second layer has cell size \deltaetadeltaphi{0.0245}{0.025} and contains the
largest energy fraction of the shower, measuring approximately 16 radiation 
lengths. The third layer, with cell size \deltaetadeltaphi{0.0245}{0.05}, collects
the tail of the shower. The first wheel of the LAr calorimeter is also segmented into
three layers with the same granularity as the barrel. The second wheel has a
coarser granularity that varies as a function of pseudorapidity. A liquid argon
pre-sampler exists for \modetalt{1.8} to correct for energy lost by incident
particles traversing material before the calorimeters.

%The liquid argon has to be maintained at a temperature of 88 K.

structure and the different granularity in the different layers. Diagram taken
from~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003}.}
\label{fig:lar-diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hadronic Calorimeters}

The hadronic calorimeter consists of a plastic scintillator tile calorimeter 
(referred to as the {\it Tile} calorimeter) covering \modetalt{1.7} and a liquid
argon endcap calorimeter (referred to as the {\it HEC}) covering
\modetabetween{15}{3.2}. 

The tile calorimeter consists of a 5.8 m long barrel covering
\modetalt{0.8} and two 2.6 m long extended barrels covering
\modetabetween{0.8}{1.7}.
It is located immediately behind the EM calorimeter, extending from a radius of
2.28 m to a radius of 4.25 m. The active material consists of 3 mm thick layers of the plastic scintillator 
placed perpendicular to the beam direction, sandwiched between a steel absorber.
The scintillators are connected at each end to
readout photomultiplier tubes by wavelength shifting fibres. The fibres are grouped
together to form readout cells, giving projective towers in $\eta$. There are
three layers of cells, with a granularity of \deltaetadeltaphi{0.1}{0.1} in the
first two layers, and \deltaetadeltaphi{0.1}{0.2} in the third.

The HEC consists of two wheels per endcap, HEC1 and HEC2, located directly
behind the EMEC and sharing the same cryostat. Each wheel has two layers of
cells. The HEC covers \modetabetween{1.5}{3.2} and so overlaps with the Tile
calorimeter on one side and the FCAL on the other, thus avoiding cracks in the
transition regions. HEC1 (HEC2) is built from 25 mm (50 mm) copper plate
absorbers interleaved with 8.5 mm gaps containing liquid argon. The liquid
argon gaps are split into four drift spaces of roughly 1.8 mm by three
electrodes. This is to avoid ion-build up due to the higher particles fluxes
and energies in the forward region, and also allows a lower high voltage than a single
electrode design.

\subsection{Forward Calorimeter}

The forward calorimeter ({\it FCAL}) covers \modetabetween{3.1}{4.9}. To reduce the
neutron flux, the FCAL begins 1.2 m away from the Electromagnetic calorimeter
front face. Due to the high particle fluxes and energies in the forward region,
the calorimeter must contain relatively long showers in the small volume allowed
by design constraints, and thus must be very dense. The FCAL is divided into
three compartments. The first, FCAL1, is designed for electromagnetic
measurements, and uses copper as an active material with liquid argon as a
passive material. The second two compartments, FCAL2 and FCAL3, are designed for hadronic
measurements, and use tungsten as a passive material, chosen for it's high
density to provide containment and minimise the lateral spread of hadronic
showers. An additional copper alloy shielding plate is places behind FCAL3 to
reduce background to the muon endcap system.

\subsection{Muon Spectrometer (MS)}

The muon spectrometer sits outside of the calorimeter system. It is designed to
provide precision muon momentum measurements over a momentum range of 3~GeV to
3~TeV, as well as providing triggering on interesting bunch crossings containing
muons. An overview of the MS is given in~\fig{muon-cutaway}. The system sits
inside a giant air coil toroidal magnet system, producing a magnetic field
orthogonal to the muon momentum to provide deflection of the
muons for momentum measurement. The use of an air coil reduces multiple
scattering which degrades the momentum resolution.

\end{figure}

The system consists of Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) and Cathode Strip Chambers
(CSC) to provide precision measurements in the bending ($y-z$) plane. The MDT
covers \modetalt{2.7} and consist of three layers. The mechanical isolation of
the sensor wire in each tube from it's neighbours give a reliable system design.
In the innermost layer, for \modetabetween{2.0}{2.7} the MDT is replaced by the
CSC due to the higher rates and higher backgrounds in this region. The CSC is a
multiwire proportional chamber, and so gives a higher granularity than the MDT
and is better able to cope with high rates and fluxes.

Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) provide triggering
for \modetalt{2.4} and a measurement in the $x-y$ plane for \modetalt{2.7}. The
RPC covers \modetalt{1.05}, with the TGC covering \modetabetween{1.05}{2.7}. The
muon trigger has a time resolution of between 1.5 ns and 4 ns.

\section{Trigger}
\label{sec:detector-trigger}

ATLAS uses a three level triggering system to identify when to read out the
detector and to reduce the event rate to a manageable level by identifying
interesting events. The collision rate of approximately 20 MHz has to be reduced
to a rate of between 200 and 1000 Hz for offline reconstruction, storage and analysis.
An overview of the ATLAS trigger system is shown in~\fig{trigger_overview}. 

The
first level, L1, uses fast custom electronics to identify the presence of signals from a hard scattering such as
hight \pt\ electrons, muons or jets, or a large amount or missing transverse
energy. The L1 trigger has a maximum latency of 2.5 \micro s, and must reduce
the rate to approximately 60 kHz (the design L1 rate was 75 kHz, however
significant detector dead-time has been observed above 75 kHz). To meet this
tight time constraint, only low-granularity signals from the calorimeters and dedicated muon trigger
chambers are used. The L1 trigger also identifies `Regions of Interest' (RoI)
surrounding the signature that caused the trigger to be fired, for use in later
levels of the trigger.

The second (L2) and third level (the `Event
Filter' or EF) triggers are software based, and are collectively known as the
`High Level Trigger' (HLT). At each level, the decision of the previous level is
refined by using more detector information and allowing a longer time for the
decision to be made and thus more complicated algorithms to be run, as well as
tightening the selection requirements to further reduce the rate. At L2 the full
readout from the RoIs identified at L1 is available. L2 uses dedicated
algorithms to return a decision based on the RoI information within 100 ms. The
EF has access to the full event readout, though typically only information
inside or just outside the RoI is used. The EF algorithms are based on the
offline object reconstruction algorithms, and may take up to one second to make
a decision.

The trigger is organised into `chains' with a L1 trigger seeding a chain of
algorithms in the HLT. Each chain is responsible for selecting a specific
trigger signature. The `trigger menu' is the collection of chains used to select
data during a run. It typically consists of about primary 200 chains for selecting data
for physics analysis and about 300 supporting chains for selecting data for
background and performance studies. The design of the trigger menu involves
balancing between the sensitivity for physics analysis resulting from the
trigger, and the need to reduce the rate to a level dictated by the available
resources for reconstruction and storage. The offline computing processing power
limits the EF trigger rate to about 400 Hz. The trigger menu had to evolve
throughout 2011 and 2012 to meet challenges posed by the constant increase in
instantaneous luminosity, and the increase of pileup to almost double the design
value. The measurements described in this analysis use single electron and muon
triggers. These triggers account for the largest slice of the trigger bandwidth,
with rates of approximately 50 Hz each. They are described in detail in ??.

\section{Detector Simulation}

Simulation of the detector response to various physics processes is a vital
ingredient to physics analysis. It is important for understanding and
calibrating the detector response to difference signatures, for estimation of
acceptances and efficiencies, and finally to be able to compare experimental
results to theoretical models. ATLAS uses a custom detector simulator which uses
the
\geant~\cite{Agostinelli2003250} toolkit to simulate interactions between
particles and matter. It takes as input the output of Monte-Carlo generators as described
in ?? in HepMC format, with all particles with a lifetime less than $c \tau >
10$ mm decayed by the generator. The simulator then propagates the particles
through the ATLAS detector, using \geant\ to simulate their interaction with the
material of the detector. 

The response of the detector components is also
simulated, and simulated output signals are produced in the same format as the
real
detector output. These are then reconstructed in the same was as
for real data (described in ???). To simulate the effect of pileup, minimum bias events generated with the \pythia
generator are overlaid with the hard event.

\section{Data Samples}

The measurements described in this thesis use data collected in 2011 and 2012,
and correspond to the full datasets collected by ATLAS in each of those two
years. The dataset is broken down into {\it runs}, a continuous period of data
taking typically corresponding to one fill of the LHC. Each run is further
broken down into {\it luminosity blocks} consisting of roughly two or three
minutes worth of data taking. Runs are grouped together into {\it periods}, with
the accelerator, detector and trigger conditions being similar in each period.
In 2011 the periods are labelled A to M, and in 2012 A to ??.

Luminosity blocks where there were problems with the detector (for example a HV
trip in the LAr) which would affect the reconstruction of electrons, muons, jets
or other physics objects are removed using a ``Good Runs List'' which records
which luminosity blocks have such defects. After removing these luminosity blocks
the integrated luminosity of 2011 dataset is \LumiPassGRLTwentyEleven\ and the integrated luminosity
of the 2012 dataset is \LumiPassGRLTwentyTwelve. The uncertainty on the
luminosity measurement is \LumiUncTwentyEleven~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2011-116,Aad:2011dr} for 2011 data and
\LumiUncTwentyTwelve\ for 2012 data.
