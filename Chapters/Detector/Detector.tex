\label{sec:Detector-SCT}

The Atlas Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT) is one of three components of the experiment's Inner Detector (ID). The SCT is a silicon strip detector, designed to reconstruct the tracks of passing charged particles. The SCT consists of 4 barrels surrounding the beam pipe and two end-caps consisting of 9 disks each. The barrels consist of 2112 separate modules and extend from a radius of 299mm from the beam line at the innermost barrel to a radius of 514mm at the outermost. The barrels are numbered from 3 to 6. Each endcap consists of 988 modules arranged in such a way that a particle must pass through four layers of the detector.

The SCT modules are made from two pairs of single sided p-in-n silicon chips biased at 150V. Charged particles passing through the depletion region at the centre of the junction produce electron hole pairs. These are swept apart by the bias voltage. The electrons are then collected on the top of the chip, producing a signal which can be read out. Each pair of chips is wire-bonded together and two pairs are glued together to form a two sided module.
