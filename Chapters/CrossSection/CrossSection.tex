\section{Observed Events}

The observed and expected event yields after applying the \ZZ\ and \ZZs\ selections are shown
in~\tab{obs-expected-events-seven} for the 7~\tev\ analysis and
in~\tab{obs-expected-events-eight} for the 8~\tev\ analysis. 
A total
of~\ZZSevenTeVNObsZZLLLL\ events
are observed in \LumiPassGRLTwentyEleven~\ifb\ of 7~\tev\ data for the \ZZ\ selection, and a total of~\ZZSevenTeVNObsZZLLLL\ events for the \ZZs\ selection. In the 8~\tev\ data, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
\LumiPassGRLTwentyTwelve~\ifb, \ZZEightTeVNObsZZLLLL\ events are observed for
the \ZZ\ selection and \ZZEightTeVNObsZZsLLLL\ for the \ZZs\ selection.

\section{Kinematic Distributions}

~\figs{zzdists-Zmass2D-seven}{zzdists-Zmass2D-eight} show the mass of the
subleading \leppair\ versus the mass of the leading \leppair\ for the 7~\tev\
and the 8~\tev\ analyses respectively. In both cases the solid red box
represents the region defined by the mass requirements of the \ZZ\ selection and
the dashed blue box the region defined by those of the \ZZs\ selection. The
events are seen to cluster in the regions where both masses are near \mZ, in
agreement with the \mc\ prediction for the signal (shown as pink boxes withe the
size of the box proportional to the number of expected events).

~\fig{zzdists-dr-ptz-seven} shows the correlation between the transverse
momentum of \leppair s and the opening-angle between the leptons
forming the pair. It is observed that for higher transverse momentum dilepton
pairs the opening-angle tends to be smaller, in good agreement with the \mc\
predictions. ~\fig{zzdists-mindr-mzz-seven} shows the
