\chapter{Background Estimate}
\label{chap:BackgroundEstimate}

The four-lepton final state is expected to be very clean with little
background, since few other interactions produce four high-\pt\ isolated leptons
in the final state. Almost all of the sources of background include one or more
\intro{background leptons}, where a background
leptons is defined as either a fake-lepton reconstructed due to jets or
photons mis-identified as a lepton, or a real lepton from decays within jets or
from photon conversions.
The dominant background contribution is expected to arise from the production of a \Z\ in
association with jets and or photons (termed \Zjets\ and \Zgamma\ below). Other
contributions arise from top-quark production (\ttbar and \singletop) and from
other diboson processes \WW\ and \WZ.
%\ttbar$\ra\W\W bb$, $\Wt\ra\W\W b$, $\Zt\ra\W\Z b$, \WW\ and \WZ.

A very small but irreducible background arises from $ZZZ$ and $WZZ$ production
and from \ttbar+$V$ where $V=\W,\Z$.
All of these processes produce large numbers of high-\pt\ isolated leptons,
however their \cx\ are very small so contribute a negigable amount to the
overall selection.

%\CX s for the background sources described above are given in~\tab{}.

\mcsim\ can be used to estimate the size of the background, however this relies
on accurate modelling of particle production within jets, so that the rate of
lepton production from hadronic decays within jets is modelled correctly, 
that the shower shapes of jets in the calorimeters are well modelled so that the
background due to jets faking leptons is well modelled, and that the isolation
variables for leptons in jets are well modelled. The \mc\ is not expected to
perform well in this area, as it relies heavily on the model used for
hadronisation and on details of the parton shower. A data-driven technique is
therefore used to estimate the background. \mc\ based background estimates are
described in~\sec{mcbg}, and the data-driven estimate is described in~\sec{ddbg}.

\section{\mc\ Background Estimates}
\label{sec:mcbg}

The \mc\ generators used to model the different sources of background are listed
in~\tab{mcbg-generators}. In a few cases different generators were used for the
8~\tev\ analysis with respect to the 7~\tev\ analysis, owing to developments in
the avilable \mc\ generators. \Zjets\ samples generated with \alpgen\ are
normalised to the inclusive NNLO \cx\ prediction of the FEWZ
program~\cite{Gavin:2010az}. The \ttbar\ samples are normalised to the
approximate NNLO calculation of HATHOR~\cite{Aliev:2010zk}. Other samples are
normalised to the \cx\ predictions of the generator used to produce them.
%The majority of the generators calculate the \cx\
%to NLO

The \mc\ estimated background for the 7~\tev\ analysis is shown
in Tables~\ref{table:mc-bg-4e},~\ref{table:mc-bg-4mu} and
~\ref{table:mc-bg-2e2mu} for the \eeee, \mmmm\ and \eemm\ final-states,
respectively, and in~\tab{mc-bg-4l} for all final-states together. The
background estimates are all statistically limits, with typically only one or
two events passing all of the selections. In the \eeee\ final-state the
background is seen to mainly arise from \Zjets, with a smaller contribution from
\WZ\ and \WW. The background to the \ZZs\ selection is significantly larger than
the background to the \ZZ\ selection, as the tighter mass cut applied in the
\ZZ\ selection rejects backgrounds where the second \Z\ candidate is formed from
background leptons. The background to the \mmmm\ final-state is seen to be
predicted to be much smaller, with the only contribution arising in the \mc\
from \WZ\ events. The total esimated background to the \ZZs\ selection is
\measStat{8.3}{\errSym{1.3}}, and the estimated background to the \ZZ\ selection
is \measStat{1.5}{\errSym{0.4}}. Since this estimated is only used as a
cross-check to the data-drive estimate, and due to lack of statistics,
systematic uncertainties on these background estimates are not evaluated.
