\chapter{Background Estimate}
\label{chap:BackgroundEstimate}

The four-lepton final state is expected to be very clean with little
background, since few other \sm\ interactions produce four high-\pt\ isolated leptons
in the final state. Almost all of the sources of background include one or more
\intro{background leptons}, where a background
lepton is defined as either a fake-lepton reconstructed due to jets or
photons mis-identified as a lepton, or a real lepton from decays within jets or
from photon conversions.
The dominant background contribution is expected to arise from the production of
a \Z\ boson in
association with jets and or photons (collectively termed \ZX). Other
contributions arise from top-quark production (\ttbar\ and \singletop) and from
other diboson processes \WW\ and \WZ\ produced in association with jets or
photons.
%\ttbar$\ra\W\W bb$, $\Wt\ra\W\W b$, $\Zt\ra\W\Z b$, \WW\ and \WZ.

An additional background arises from $ZZZ$ and $WZZ$ production
and from \ttbar+$V$ where $V=\W,\Z$. In these backgrounds there are four leptons
from \W\ or \Z\ boson decays, so they will tend to be isolated and have small
impact parameters, making these irreducible sources of background.
The \cx\ for these processes are, however, very small, so they contribute only a
small fraction of the overall background. 
%\CX s for the background sources described above are given in~\tab{}.

\mcsim\ can be used to estimate the size of the background, however this relies
on accurate modelling of particle production within jets. Accurate modelling is
important so that the rate of
lepton production from hadronic decays within jets is represented correctly, and so
that the shower shapes of jets in the calorimeters are well described, in order
for the rate at which jets fake the electron identification is well
predicted. In
order for leptons or fakes to pass the analysis selection requirements they must
also pass the
isolation requirement; background leptons will therefore tend to be in the
tails
of the jet distribution where the energy density due to other particles in the jet
is lower. The \mcsim\ is not expected to
perform well in this area, as it relies heavily on the model used for
hadronisation and on details of the parton shower. A data-driven method is
therefore used to estimate the background from events with one or two background
leptons. This method estimates the expected combined background from \ZX,
\Zgamma, \WW, \WZ, \ttbar, and \singletop. \mcsim\ is used to estimate the
irreducible backgrounds, and as a cross check to the data-driven estimate.

\mc\ based background estimates are
described in~\sec{mcbg}, and the data-driven estimate is described in~\sec{ddbg}.

\section{\mc\ Background Estimates}
\label{sec:mcbg}

The \mc\ generators used to model the different sources of background are listed
in~\tab{mcbg-generators}. In a few cases different generators were used for the
8~\tev\ analysis with respect to the 7~\tev\ analysis, owing to developments in
the avilable \mc\ generators. \ZX\ samples generated with \alpgen\ are
normalised to the inclusive NNLO \cx\ prediction of the FEWZ
program~\cite{Gavin:2010az}. The \ttbar\ samples are normalised to the
approximate NNLO calculation of HATHOR~\cite{Aliev:2010zk}. Other samples are
normalised to the \cx\ predictions of the generator used to produce them.
%The majority of the generators calculate the \cx\
%to NLO

The \mc\ estimated background for the 7~\tev\ analysis is shown
in~\tab{mc-bg-seven}, separately for each source of background and for each final state. The
background estimates are all statistically limited, with typically only one or
two events passing all of the selections for each source of background. In the \eeee\ final-state, the
background is seen to arise mainly from \ZX, with a smaller contribution from
\WZ\ and \WW. The background to the \ZZs\ selection is significantly larger than
the background to the \ZZ\ selection, as the tighter mass cut applied in the
\ZZ\ selection rejects backgrounds where the second \Z\ boson candidate is formed from
background leptons. The background to the \mmmm\ final-state is estimated to be
much smaller, with the only contribution in the \mcsim\ arising
from \WZ\ events. For the 7~\tev\ analysis, no \mc\
samples were available to model the \trilep\ background. In order to estimate
the size of the background from these processes, the 8~\tev\ samples are used, applying the 7~\tev\
selection and normalising to the 7~\tev\ \cx\ and luminosity.
For the 7~\tev\ analysis, the total estimated background to the \ZZ\ selection due
to fakes is
\ZZSevenTeVMCBgEstRedZZLLLL; the estimated background to the \ZZs\ selection
is \ZZSevenTeVMCBgEstRedZZsLLLL. The estimated irreducible background
is~\ZZSevenTeVMCBgEstIredZZLLLL\ for the \ZZ\ selection
and~\ZZSevenTeVMCBgEstRedZZsLLLL\ for the \ZZs\ selection.
%Since this estimate is only used as a
%cross-check to the data-drive estimate, and due to lack of statistics,
%systematic uncertainties on these background estimates are not evaluated.
The \mc\ estimated backgrounds to the 8~\tev\ analysis are shown
in~\tab{mc-bg-eight}. For the 8~\tev\ analysis, the estimated background
due to fakes is~\ZZEightTeVMCBgEstRedZZLLLL\ and the estimated irreducible
background is~\ZZEightTeVMCBgEstIredZZLLLL.

\section{Data Driven Background Estimates}

\label{sec:ddbg}

\subsection{Methodology}

The reducible background sources fall into two categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Backgrounds with two prompt isolated leptons and two `background' leptons. Such
background include \ZX, \Zgamma, \WW+jets, \ttbar\ and \singletop\ (in the
$s$ and $t$ channels).
\item Backgrounds with three prompt isolated leptons and one `background'
lepton. Such backgrounds include \WZ+jets and \singletop\ production in the \Wt\
channel.
\end{itemize}

Denoting true leptons passing all of the selection requirements as $T$ and
background leptons as $B$, the total background due to background leptons can be
experessed as:

\begin{equation}
N_{4l}^{\rm fake} = N_{TTTB} \times f + N_{TTBB} \times f^{2}
\label{eqn:bg-4l-true}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the \frate, the fraction of background leptons that pass the full lepton selection
requirements. Of course, given a selected lepton in data it is impossible to
know whether it is a true lepton or a background lepton (if it were, background
rejection would be trivial). Instead, in order to measure the background 
two new definitions are introduced: \intro{\sellep s}, denoted $L$, that
pass all of the lepton selection requirements; and \intro{lepton-like-jets},
denoted $J$, which
pass most of the selection requirements, but fail a few selected requirements.
The background is estimated by extrapolating from control regions containing
two or three \sellep s and one one or two \lljet (s) using the
\intro{\ffactor}, \FF, defined as the ratio of the probability for a background lepton to be
classified as a \sellep\ to the probability for it to be classified as a \lljet.
In a sample containing only \bglep s, the \frate\ and \ffactor\ are given by: 

\begin{equation}
f = \frac{N_{L}}{N_{L} + N_{J}},\ \FF = \frac{N_{L}}{N_{J}}
\end{equation}
where $N_{L}$ and $N_{J}$ are the number of \sellep s and \lljet s in the sample,
respectively. \FF\ and \f\ are thus related by:
\begin{equation}
\f = \frac{\FF}{1 + \FF},\ \FF = \frac{\f}{1-\f}
\label{eqn:bg-f-FF-relations}
\end{equation}

%Events observed as having three $L$ and one $J$ ($LLLJ$) arise from events with two $T$ and
%two $B$ where one $B$ is classified as a $J$ and one is classified as an $L$ and
%from events with three $T$ and one $B$ where the $B$ is classified as a $J$. The
%number of $LLLJ$ events is thus related to the number of $TTBB$ and $TTTB$
%events by:
%\begin{equation}
%N_{LLLJ} = N_{TTTB} \times (1-f) + N_{TTBB} \times 2f(1-f)
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\f = \frac{\FF}{1 + \FF},\ \FF = \frac{\f}{1-\f}
%\label{eqn:bg-f-FF-relations}
%\end{equation}
%%The number of events with two \lljet s and two \sellep\ s is related to the
%%number of events with two true leptons and two \bglep s by:
%Events with two $L$ and two $J$ ($LLJJ$) only arise from events with two $T$ and
%two $B$, where both $B$ are classified as $J$
%Similary, the number of events with two $L$ and two $J$ ($LLJJ$) is related to the
%number of events with two $T$ and two $B$ by:
%\begin{equation}
%N_{LLJJ} = N_{TTBB} \times (1-f)^{2}
%\end{equation}

The number of events observed with three $L$ and one $J$, deonted $N_{LLLJ}$, is related to
the true composition by:
\begin{align}
N_{LLLJ} &= N_{TTTB} \times (1-f)\, +\, N_{TTBB} \times 2f(1-f) \notag \\
         &+ N_{TBBB} \times 3f^{2}(1-f)\, +\,  N_{BBBB} \times 4f^{3}(1-f) 
\end{align}
where the numerical factors arise due to combinatorics. Similarly, the number of
events with two $L$ and two $J$, denoted $N_{LLJJ}$, is related to the
true compostion by:
\begin{equation}
N_{LLJJ} = N_{TTBB} \times (1-f)^{2} + N_{TBBB} \times 3 f(1-f)^{2}  + N_{BBBB}
\times 6 f^{2}(1-f)^{2}
\end{equation}
%Similary, the number of events with three \sellep s and one \lljet\ can be related to the
%number of events with two or three true leptons and two or three \bglep s by:
Since $f$ is small,
terms of order $f^{3}$ or higher are neglected.

The background to the four-lepton selection given in~\eqn{bg-4l-true} can 
be rewritten in terms of the number of events in the $LLLJ$ and $LLJJ$ control
regions as:
\begin{align}
N_{4l}^{\rm fake} &= N_{LLLJ} \times \FF - N_{LLJJ} \times \FF^{2} \notag \\
 &= N_{TTTB} \times (1-\f) \FF + N_{TTBB} \times 2\f (1 - \f) \FF \notag \\
 &\quad - N_{TTBB} \times (1-\f)^{2} \FF^{2} \notag \\
 &=  N_{TTTB} \times \f + N_{TTBB} \times 2 f^{2} - N_{TTBB} \times \f^{2} \notag \\
 &= N_{TTTB} \times \f + N_{TTBB} \times f^{2} 
\end{align}
where use has been made of~\eqn{bg-f-FF-relations}. In reality, observed
$LLJJ$ and $LLLJ$ events will include some contribution from \ZZllll\ events where
one or two leptons fail the selection requirements and are classified as $J$.
The background estimate is thus:
\begin{equation}
N_{4l}^{\rm fake} = (N^{obs}_{LLLJ} - N^{\ZZ}_{LLLJ}) \times \FF -
(N^{obs}_{LLJJ} - N^{\ZZ}_{LLJJ})\times \FF^{2} 
\end{equation}
where $N^{\ZZ}_{LLLJ}$ and $N^{\ZZ}_{LLJJ}$ are the number of \ZZ\ events with
one or two leptons being classified as $J$; these must be estimated from \mcsim.

\subsection{Lepton-Like-Jet Definitions}

%The nominal requirements for \lljet s are given below.
A \intro{pre-lepton} is defined as a reconstructed lepton object that passes all of
the selection requirements, apart from the isolation and \dzero-significance
requirements (for muons) or the isolation and \loosePP\ identification
requirements (for electrons). The pre-leptons may than be classified as either \lljet s or \sellep s.
Pre-Muons that fail {\it either} the isolation {\it or} the
\dzero-significance requirement are classified as $J$. Those that pass both requirements are
classified as $L$; those that fail both are
discarded. Similarly, pre-electrons that fail {\it either} the isolation {\it or} the
\loosePP\ significance requirement are classified as $J$; those that fail both are
discarded. For the 7~\tev\ analysis where both calorimeter and track isolation
requirements are used, a lepton may fail either the track or caloriemter requirement
to be considerd a $J$. For forward electrons, for which no isolation
requirements are applied, pre-leptons are classified as $J$
if they fail the \tight\ ID requirement. For forward \standAlone\ muons which have
no track, pre-leptons are classified as $J$ if they fail the isolation
requirements. A summary of the $J$ definitions is
given in~\tab{J-def}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Fake-Factor Measurement}

In order to measure the \fakefactor, a sample of \bglepton s must be
identified, with a similar composition in terms of the different sources of
\bglepton s as the signal sample. This is done using a \intro{\Z-tag} sample, selecting 
events containing an \ossf\ \dilep\ pair passing all of the lepton
selection requirements. The pair must have invariant mass $|m_{\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}|<20$~\gev, in order to be consistent with a \Z\
boson. It is then required that the event contain at least one additional
pre-lepton. The sample will be dominated by \ZX, \WZ\ and \ZZ\
events. The additional pre-leptons in \ZX\ events are all background
electrons; in \WZ\ and \ZZ\ events there will typically be one or two additional
true leptons. The \WZ\ component is supressed by rejecting events with large missing transverse
energy (requiring \Etmiss$<$25~\gev). The \ZZ\ component and any remaining \WZ\
is subtracted using \mc. The \Z-tag sample selection is summarised~\tab{Ztag-def}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{lc} 
    \hline\hline
    Criteria & Requirement \\
    \hline
    Trigger & Single electron and muon triggers as described in~\sec{triggers}.\\
    Leptons & An \ossf\ pair of selected leptons.\\
            & $\geq 1$ trigger matched. \\
    \Z-tag & $|m_{\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}|<20$~\gev \\
    \Etmiss & \Etmiss$<$25~\gev \\
    \hline\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Event selection requirements for the \Z-tag sample used to measure
  the \ffactor.}
  \label{table:Ztag-def}
\end{table}

The pre-leptons are then identified as either $L$ or
$J$ (or neither), and the \fakefactor s are obtained by dividing the distributions
of the \lljet\ by the distributions of the \sellep. In this way, \fakefactor s
parameterised in \pT\ and in $\eta$ are obtained. For a given bin of \pT\ or $\eta$, the \ffactor\ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\FF = \frac{N^{\rm data}_{L} - N^{{\rm MC}\; WZ,ZZ}_{L}}
{N^{\rm data}_{J} - N^{{\rm MC}\; WZ,ZZ}_{J}}
\end{equation}

The fake-factor for a given \pT\ and $\eta$ is applied as:
\begin{equation}
\FF(\pt,\eta) = \frac{FF(\pt)\times\FF(\eta)}{<\FF>}
\label{eqn:factorised-ff}
\end{equation}
where $<\FF>$ is the unparameterised (average) \ffactor.

The resulting distributions of \pT\ and $\eta$ for the \sellep\ and \lljet s for
electrons are shown in~\fig{ljdist-el-seven} for the
7~\tev\ analysis and in~\fig{ljdist-el-eight} for the 8~\tev\ analysis.
~\figs{ljdist-mu-seven}{ljdist-mu-eight} show the equivalent distributions for
muons.

\subsection{Statistical and Systematic Uncertainties}

The statistical error from the \ffactor\ measurement is propagated to the
background estimate by repeating the calculation with the \ffactor\ shifted up and down
by their one-sigma statistical uncertainties. The variation of the predicted
background is then added in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty due to
limited numbers of observed $LLLJ$ and $LLJJ$ events. 
%In cases where no $LLLJ$
%or $LLJJ$ events are observed, the central value is taken as zero, and the
%uncertainty is set to correspond to a 68\% confidence level upper limit on the
%number of observed events of 1.29. This is scaled by the mean \ffactor\ for that
%channel.

Systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying the criteria used to define
the \lljet s as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increasing the inverted isolation requirement to $>$20\%, $>$30\%, and
$>$40\%. For the 7~\tev\ data, where both track and calroimeter isolation are
used, the requirements on the two isolations are varied
simultaneously.
\item Increasing the inverted \dzero-significance requirement to
$>3.5$ (8~\tev\ only), $>4.0,>4.5,>5.0$.
%\item Requiring that the $J$ fail {\it either} the isolation {\it or} the
%identification (\dzero-significance) requirements, but not both.
\end{itemize}
The variations are designed to vary the composition of the different regions in
terms of the different sources of background leptons. Stability under these
variations indicates that the method is not highly sensitive to the composition
of the control region relative to the composition of the signal region. The
final background estimate is taken as the mean of the nominal background
estimate and the estimate obtained under each of these variations. The
statistical uncertainty is taken as the mean of the statistical uncertainties
from each variation and the systematic is taken as the RMS spread of the
estimates obtained from different variations.

\subsection{\mc\ Closure Test}

To demonstrate the validity of the background estimate method, a \mc\ closure
test is performed. The entire background estimate methodology described above is
applied to a \mc\ sample modelling the \ZX, \ttbar,
\singletop, \WZ\ and \WW\ backgrounds, to give a `background estimate' according
to the \mc. The \ffactor s are derived from the \mc, and are then applied
to $LLJJ$ and $LLLJ$ events from the \mc\ samples. The resulting `background
estimate' should then be in agreement with the number of $LLLL$ events passing the full
selection in the background \mc\ sample.

The results of the closure test are shown in~\tab{bg-est-mc-closure}. The
statistical uncertainties on the 8~\tev\ estimates are much larger, owing to the
size of the available \mc\ samples at 8~\tev\ being far smaller. In all cases, the
background estimate from \mc\ obtained using the \ffactor\ method is in good
agreement with the number of $LLLL$ events in the \mc.

\subsection{Results}

The number of observed $LLLJ$ and $LLJJ$ events, these quantities multiplied by
the \fakefactor\ (squared in the latter case), the estimated correction due to
contamination from \ZZ\ events, and the resulting background estimate for the `nominal' $J$ definition are shown
in~\tab{bg-est-nominal-seven} for the 7~\tev\
data and in~\tab{bg-est-nominal-eight} for the 8~\tev\ data. The \ffactor\ is
applied individually to each $J$, parameterised by the \pt\ and $\eta$ of the
$J$. The background
estimates under each of the systematic variations described in the previous section are
shown in~\tabs{bg-est-syst-seven}{bg-est-syst-eight}. The results are observed
to be rather stable under the systematic variations, within the large statistica
uncertainties.

In the \mmmm\ channel the number of observed $LLLJ$ and $LLJJ$ events is small,
and so the final background estimate is zero due to \NLLJJ\ being larger than
\NLLLJ. In this case, the final result is quoted as a truncated Gaussian, with
mean at zero and sigma equal to the estimated uncertainty. This procedure gives a
conservative upper limit for the background in that channel.
The final data-driven background estimates are shown
in~\tab{bg-est-final-dd}.

\subsection{Cross Check with Same-Sign Events}

An additional cross check of the background estimate is performed by estimating
the background using a data sample composed of events passing the full event
selection, but with one opposite-signed \dilep\ pair and one same-signed \dilep\
pair (termed OS-SS). The majority of the irreducible backgrounds due to \Zgamma,
\Z+light-jets, \ttbar, \WW\ and \WZ\ events will contribute to the OS-SS
selection at the same rate as to the signal selection with two oppositely-signed
pairs (SS-SS). The exception to this is \Zbb, where leptons from heavy flavour
decay will tend to be oppositely-charged in the two jets. There will be
significant contamination to this control region from \ZZ\ events where one
lepton has its charged misidentified. This is estimated from \mc, and subtracted
from the observed OS-SS events to give the background estimate by this method. 

The number of observed events passing the OS-SS selection, the
estimated \ZZ\ contamination and the resulting background estimate are shown
in~\tab{bg-est-ss} for the 8~\tev\ analysis (this cross-check was not performed
for the 7~\tev\ data). The results are in good agreement with the background
estimate from the \ffactor\ method.

\section{Background Shape}

Due to the lack of statistics in the background \mc\ samples it is not possible
to obtain a background shape using the full event selection. In the 7~\tev\
data, there are also not enough statistics in the data control regions to obtain
a background shape. For the 7~\tev\ analysis, the background shape is therefore
taken from \mc\ with a loosened selection. For the background shape, events are
required to have an opposite-sign pair of leptons passing all of the selection
requirements. The second pair is not required to be same-signed, and the lepton
isolation and \dzero-significance requirements are not applied.  Apart from
this, the full event selection, including mass cuts, is applied.  Applying this
selection, sufficient statistics are obtained from \mc\ to give reasonable
shapes in distributions of interest (e.g. \Z\ boson mass and \pt, four-lepton
mass, four-lepton \pt).

To account for the different efficiencies in the loosened selection criteria in
events with a ``loose'' electron pair and a ``loose'' muon pair, events of each
type are scaled by the ratio of the number of events which pass the nominal
selection to the number of events which pass the loosened selection.  
The ``loose'' electron pair efficiency was measured to be 0.051
while the ``loose'' muon pair efficiency  was measured to be 0.012.  This
scaling is used to account for any difference in shape between events with the
a ``loose'' electron pair and a ``loose'' muon pair.  The distributions thus
obtained are then normaised to the data-driven
background estimates shown in~\tab{bg-est-final}. 
%The statistical error on the full
%data-driven estimate was propagated to the per bin estimates and combined with
%the statistical error on the histogram while the systematic error per bin was
%solely propagated from the data-driven estimate.  

For the 8~\tev\ analysis, the background shape is taken from data, using $LLJJ$
events but treating the lepton-like jets are treated as fully selected leptons.  The
events are weighted by the fake factors for the lepton-like jets, and the
overall normalisation of the distribution is scaled to the data-drive background
estimate as shown in~\tab{bg-est-final}.  
%The statistical error on the full data-driven estimate was propagated to the
%per bin estimates and combined with the statistical error on the histogram
%while the systematic error per bin was solely propagated from the data-driven
%estimate.
