\section{Sources of background}
The four-lepton final state is expected to be very clean with very little
background, since few other interactions produce four high-\pt\ isolated leptons
in the final state. There are two categories of backgrounds: \intro{irreducible}
backgrounds which contain four high-\pt\ isolated leptons, and \intro{reducible}
backgrounds that include one or more \intro{background leptons}. Background
leptons are defined to be either fake leptons reconstructed due to jets or
photons mis-identified as a lepton, or a real lepton from decays within jets.
