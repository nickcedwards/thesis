\section{Sources of background}
The four-lepton final state is expected to be very clean with little
background, since few other interactions produce four high-\pt\ isolated leptons
in the final state. Almost all of the sources of background include one or more
\intro{background leptons}, where a background
leptons is defined as either a fake-lepton reconstructed due to jets or
photons mis-identified as a lepton, or a real lepton from decays within jets or
from photon conversions.
The dominant background contribution is expected to arise from the production of a \Z\ in
association with jets and or photons (termed \Zjets\ and \Zgamma\ below). Other
contributions arise from \ttbar$\ra\W\W bb$, $\Wt\ra\W\W b$, $\Zt\ra\W\Z b$,
\WW\ and \WZ.

A very small but irreducible background arises from $ZZZ$ and $WZZ$ production.
Both of these processes produce large numbers of high-\pt\ isolated leptons,
however their \cx\ are very small so contribute a negigable amount to the
overall selection.
