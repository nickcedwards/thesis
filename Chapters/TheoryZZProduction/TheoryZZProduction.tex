\section{Introduction}

Production of pairs of \Z\ bosons, so called \intro{diboson \ZZ\ production} is a
rare process at particle colliders, but has a very striking signature
and low backgrounds. The study of diboson \ZZ\ production is of great interest
as it provides a precision test of the \sm, and unique opportunity to
probe the structure of the electroweak sector. 
The $ZZZ$ and $ZZ\gamma$ neutral triple gauge boson
couplings (nTGCs) are zero in the Standard Model, but are predicted to exist at the
level of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ in certain new-physics
models~\cite{Ellison:1998}. Non-resonant \ZZ\ production is also the
irreducible background to \HZZ\ decays, one of key channels in Higgs boson physics
at the LHC. The CMS~\cite{CMS_Higgs:2012gu} and ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS_Higgs:2012gk}
experiments both recently reported the discovery of a new boson with mass near
125 \gev\ in the search for the Higgs boson. \HZZ\ decays were a key
search channel for this discovery, contributing a local significance of 3.6
$\sigma$ to the overall local significance of 6.0 $\sigma$ (the other
contributing channels were \Hgg\ and \HWW). Understanding non-resonant \ZZ\
production was essential for such a discovery, and continues to be important for
studying the properties of the new boson.

\section{\ZZ\ production at hadron colliders}

At hadron colliders, \qqZZ\ proceeds at tree level via $t$- and $u$-channel
quark-antiquark annihilation as shown in~\fig{theoryzz-fd-qqZZ}. Since \ZZZ\ and
\ZZg\ couplings are forbidden in the \sm\ there is no contribution from
$s$-channel $q\bar{q}$ annihilation at tree level, although contributions from
fermion loops contribute at $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$~\cite{Gounaris:2000dn}.
Gluon-gluon fusion processes will also
contribute via quark box diagrams, as shown in~\fig{theoryzz-fd-ggZZ}. Although
these are NNLO and are suppressed by a factor of
$\alpha_s^2$, due to the high gluon content of the proton at LHC energies they
still contribute a sizeable fraction of the total \ZZ\ production \cx\,
contributing approximately 10\%~\cite{Campbell:2011} of the \cx,
depending on the centre of mass energy and the definition of the \cx.
This is discussed in more detail below.

\subsection{\ZZ\ Decay Modes}

\Z\ bosons can decay to a quark-antiquark pair, a neutrino-antineturino pair or
a pair of oppositely charged leptons. The branching fractions to each of the
final states are well known~\cite{PDG}, and are 69.9\% for $q \bar{q}$, 20.0\%
for $\nu\bar{\nu}$ and 10.1\% for \ll. In \ZZ\ decays, each boson decays
independently, so the branching fraction for a given final state is the product
of the branching fractions for the two \Z\ bosons. The measurements in this
thesis are all based on measurements of \ZZllll, where $\ell = e,\mu$, giving
three final states \eeee, \mmmm\ and \eemm. The
branching fractions to these final states are as follows:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{B}(\ZZeeee) = 0.113 \errSym{0.008}\,\% \\
\mathcal{B}(\ZZmmmm) = 0.113 \errSym{0.014}\,\% \\
\mathcal{B}(\ZZeemm) = 0.226 \errSym{0.016}\,\% 
\end{align}

\subsection{Cross Section Definition}

The \cx\ for non-resonant \ZZ\ production can be defined in a number of
ways. One definition is to use a zero-width approximation for the \Z\ bosons and
calculate a total \cx. Alternatively, the natural width of the \Z\
bosons can be used, and requirements made on the invariant masses of the \Z\
bosons to define a \cx. In this thesis, measurements of two total \ZZ\ \cx s
are presented: an \intro{on-shell} \cx\, assuming natural width for the
\Z\ bosons and requiring both bosons have mass in the range \sstooosZ, and a
\cx\ allowing one of the \Z\ bosons to be off shell with $m_{\Z}>20$
\gev.

Measurements are also presented in a restricted phase space, termed a
\intro{fiducial volume}, which corresponds closely to the experimental selection
requirements described in~\chap{ObjEventSelection}. The corresponding
\intro{fiducial \cx} has smaller theoretical uncertainties than the total \cx,
where uncertainties on the extrapolation from the experimentally measured
fiducial \cx\ to the total \cx\ arise due to uncertainties on the \partDF\ and
the factorisation and renormalisation scales. The fiducial volumes used for the
7 \tev\ and the 8 \tev\ measurements are slightly different, reflecting the
different experimental selections. They are defined below. The fiducial
\cx s are measured using decays where both \Z\ bosons decay to either electrons
or muons. The fiducial
\cx s are then extrapolated to the total \cx  correcting for
the geometric acceptance of the fiducial volume and the branching
fractions to leptons.

\subsubsection{7 \tev\ Fiducial Cross Section Definitions}

The \zzllll\ on-shell (\ZZ) fiducial \cx\ is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\ZorgZorglplmlplm, $\ell = e,\mu$}
\item{ $66 < m_{12}(\Zorgv) <  116\GeV$, where $m_{12}(\Zorgv)$ is
the mass of the \Z\ reconstructed from the first and second leptons.  The
lepton pairings are assigned by choosing the set of 
same-flavor, opposite-sign lepton pairs that minimises the sum of distances from
the PDG~\cite{PDG} value of the \Z\ mass:
\begin{equation}
|m_{1,2}(\Zorgv) - \mZPDG| + |m_{3,4}(\Zorgv) - \mZPDG|
\end{equation}
}
\item{ $66 < m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*) <  116\GeV$, where $m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*)$ is
the mass of the \Z\ reconstructed from the third and fourth leptons;}
\item All four leptons have transverse momentum satisfying $\pT^{\ell} > 7\GeV$;
\item All four leptons have pseudo-rapidity satisfying $|\eta^{\ell}| < 3.16$.
\item{ The minimum distance between any two leptons in the event must satisfy
$\mathrm{min}(\dR(\ell,\ell)) > 0.2$, where $\dR = \sqrt{\Delta \phi^{2} +
\Delta \eta^{2}}$.}
\end{itemize}

The \zzllll\ fiducial \cx , allowing one \Z\ to be off-shell ($ZZ^*$), is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
\item $(\Z/\gamma^*)(\Z/\gamma^*)\rightarrow\ll\ll$, $\ell = e,\mu$;
\item $66 < m_{12}(\Z/\gamma^*) <  116\GeV$;
\item $m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*) > 20\GeV$;
\item $\pT^{\ell} > 7\GeV$;
\item $|\eta^{\ell}| < 3.16$.
\item $\mathrm{min}(|\Delta R(\ell,\ell)|) > 0.2$.
\end{itemize}

In this case the tighter mass cut is applied to the pair closest to the PDG \Z\
boson mass.

\subsection{Cross Section}

~\tab{cx-eemm-mcfm} shows \cx s for the \ZZeemm\ process at 7 \tev\ and
at 8 \tev, calculated using version 6.3 of the
\mcfm\cite{Campbell:2011} program. The \cx\  in the zero-width approximation is shown, as
well as the \cx s allowing for the natural width of the \Z\ boson and
applying mass cuts.  The \cx s after applying the requirements defining
the fiducial volume are also shown. 
In all cases, the CT10~\cite{CT10} \partDF\ set is used, and the factorisation and renormalisation scales are set
to $\mu_{R} = \mu_{F} = \frac{1}{2} \mZZ$. The error due to the \partDF\ 
uncertainty is
evaluated by using the 52 CT10 error sets and by taking the difference in \cx\ 
obtained when using the MSTW08NLO~\cite{bib:MSTW2008} \partDF\ set. The error 
due to the choice of
\fact\ and \renorm\ scales is evaluated by varying them
simultaneously up and down by a factor of two. 

Total \cx s are shown in~\tab{cx-total-mcfm}. These are also
calculated using the \mcfm\ program, with the settings as described above, by
calculating the \cx\  for \ZZeemm\ then correcting for the branching
fraction $\mathcal{B}(\ZZeemm)$. 

The percentage contributions from
gluon-gluon fusion processes are shown in~\tab{theory-gg-frac}.

\section{Monte-Carlo Simulation}

Simulated data samples are a crucial ingredient to a particle physics
measurement for a number of reasons. It is of course important to be able to
compare experimentally measured quantities such ad \cx s and kinematic
distributions with predictions from the theory. Furthermore, simulated data
samples are important for calibrating the detector response and for estimating
selection efficiencies in order to translate from the number of observed events
to a physical quantity such as a \cx. 

Simulated data samples are obtained by
means of \mc\ simulation, which use numerical integration to calculate matrix
elements and generate events. Generating events suitable for the purposes
outlined in the last paragraph typically consists of four steps number of steps:
calculation of the matrix element for the hard scattering, the parton shower,
hadronisation and finally embedding in the underlying event. These are described
in more details below. The calculation of the matrix element is
made at a fixed order in perturbative QFT, where the expansion is in terms of
the strong coupling constant \alphaS. The event generators used in this thesis
are either \intro{Leading Order (LO)}, where only the simplest diagrams
contributing to a process are calculated, or \intro{Next to Leading Order (NLO},
where contributions from one loop diagrams are included. 

Both the incoming and any outgoing quarks and gluons
(collectively, partons) will emit soft collinear radiation in the form of other quarks and gluons. This is
modelled by the parton shower (PS), which in the case of outgoing partons
successively radiates the partons until they reach an energy of $\sim 1$ \gev, at
which point the predictions of perturbative QCD become invalid and the partons
are formed into hadrons in a process called hadronisation. For the incoming partons, the
shower is run in-reverse back to the \intro{factorisation scale, \uF}, at which
point the calculation is connected to a \intro{Parton Density Function
(\partDF)} which describe the probability to find a parton $i$ carrying a
fraction $x_i$ of the incoming proton momentum at energy scale \uF. The
factorisation scale thus sets the boundary between hard, perturbative QCD and
soft, non-perturbative QCD. The \partDF s are determined from fits to
experimental data. It is necessary to `match' the
ME calculation to the PS, to ensure no double counting in events with hard
outgoing partons. Different generators use different models for the parton
shower, hadronisation, and the ME-PS matching.

A second scale involved in the generation of events is the
\intro{renormalisation scale, \uR}. Since gluons are massless, QCD contains UV
divergences which lead to infinite results in cross-section calculations. Since 
this is clearly unphysical, a renormalisation procedure is used to cancel the
divergences, for example by introducing a gluon mass or setting a UV cutoff
scale to regularise the divergence. The divergences are then absorbed by a
redefinition of the `bare' parameters of the theory to the physically observable
parameters. Renormalised parameters such as \alphaS are thus dependant on \uR.
When performing calculations to all orders of perturbation theory,  the results
should not depend on the choice of \uR\ - however since in LO and NLO only the
first few terms of the expansion are kept, the results will heavily depend on
the choice of both \uR\ and \uF. Calculations performed at NLO are expected to
be less dependant on the choice of scale than LO calculations, however
theoretical uncertainties must be assigned to account for the dependence on the
(somewhat arbitrary) choice of scale.

\subsection{\mc\ generators}

A wide range of \mc\ integrators and event generators are available to simulate
processes of interest at the LHC, each specialised to a specific purpose. The
following generators are used in this thesis. For each generator, an outline of
how it is used and its general properties is given.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \mcfm ~\cite{Campbell:2011} is designed to calculate \cx s for
    femtobarn-level processes at hadron colliders. Matrix elements are
    calculated at NLO, incorporating full spin correlations. \mcfm\ is a \cx\
    calculator only and cannot produce unweighted events suitable for use in a
    physics analysis. Nevertheless it provides a useful toolkit for calculating
    \cx s, estimating the acceptance of the fiducial volume and studying the
    associated uncertainties due to \partDF\ and scale uncertainties.

    \item \powhegbox~\cite{Alioli:2010xd} is a general framework for implementing
    NLO calculations. It uses the \powheg\ method to match the NLO matrix
    elements to the parton shower. \powhegbox\ must be interfaced to an external
    program for the implementation of the parton shower - in this thesis
    \powhegbox\ is interfaced to \pythia for showering. Specific details of the
    implementation of the \ZZ\ process in \powhegbox\ is given
    in~\cite{Melia:2011tj}; the \ggZZ\ process is not included. 
    Samples generated using \powhegbox\ are used as the main signal samples for
    the \qqZZ\ process, used to optimise the selection, estimate selection
    acceptances and systematics and compare observed distributions with theory.

    \item \ggtwoZZ~\cite{gg2ZZ} is a specialist generator used to simulate the
    \ggZZ\ process. Events generated with \ggtwoZZ\ are used in conjunction with
    the \powhegbox\ events as the main signal sample. It is interfaced to the
    \herwig\ to provide the parton shower and \jimmy~\cite{bib:jimmy} to model the underlying
    event. It's sister generator, \ggtwoWW, is used to simulate the background
    from \ggZZ~\cite{Binoth:2006mf}.

    \item \sherpa~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta} is a LO generator, capable of
    generating up to three additional hard partons in the matrix element. It
    uses an extended version of the CKKW scheme~\cite{Hoeche:2009rj} to match to the matrix element to the parton shower,
    and provides its own simulation of the parton shower, QED radiation and
    the underlying event. \sherpa\ is also capable of simulating aTGCs. It is
    used as a cross-check to \powhegbox\ and \ggZZ\ and to estimates the impact
    of uncertainties
    arising from different implementations of the parton shower and QED
    radiation. It is also used to simulate aTGC samples.
    Version 1.3.1 is used to simulate \qqZZllll\ at 7 \tev, and 1.4.0 is used at
    8 \tev.

    \item \pythia is a LO generator which uses a library of $2\ra2$
    matrix elements covering almost all \sm processes to model the signal
    process and a \pt\ ordered parton shower to model additional radiation.
    The Fortran77 based
    \pythia6~\cite{pythia} is used at 7 \tev\, whilst the C++ based
    \pythia8~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} is used at 8 \tev. \pythia is used to
    provide showering for many of the other generators described here, and is
    also used as a cross-check to the main signal samples.

    \item \herwig~\cite{Herwig} is another general purpose LO generator, generating events in a
    similar way is used to \pythia, but using an angular-ordered parton shower.
    %and cluster model for hadronisation.
    It is used for generating inclusive samples (all final
    states) of $WW$ and $WZ$ production, used in estimating background from
    other diboson processes.

    \item \herwigPP~\cite{Bahr:2008pv} is a C++ based generator based on the
    Fortran \herwig. It includes NLO calculations of a number of processes
    using the \powheg\ matching scheme. \herwigPP\ is only used for comparison
    of \ZZ\ event kinematics at generator level.

    \item \mcatnlo~\cite{bib:mcatnlo} is a NLO generator, and was the first
    generator to implement NLO ME to PS matching, using the so-called \mcatnlo\
    technique. \mcatnlo\ is used to simulate the background processes \ttbar, \Wt
    and single-top at 7 \tev. \mcatnlo\ can simulate \qqZZ, but only in the
    zero-width approximation where the lineshape of the \Z\ boson is not
    included. For this reason \mcatnlo\ is not used for signal simulation,
    though the generator level predictions of \mcatnlo\ are compared to other
    generators in the following section.

    \item \alpgen~\cite{alpgen} is a LO genertor for simulating multi-parton
    processes in hadron interactions. It can simulate $W$ and \Z\ production
    with up to 6 additional partons in the matrix element. It is interfaced to
    \herwig\ for the parton shower, using the MLM matching
    scheme~\cite{Mangano2002343}. It is used to simulate \W\ and \Z\ bosons in
    association with jets, as well as low mass Drell-Yan and \Wg.

    %\item \pythiaB is used to simulate events with heavy favour dijets. Since
    %these are of interest as background processes to events with leptons, a
    %dilepton filter is applied at generator level, requiring two $e$ or $\mu$ with
    %\ptgt{10}.

    %\item \madgraph~\cite{madgraph} \Wg\ and \Zg (7 tev).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison of \ZZllll\ at 7 \tev\ and 8 \tev}

Figures~\ref{fig:gen-comp-7-8-ZZ} and ~\ref{fig:gen-comp-7-8-ZZs} show comparisons of the kinematic distributions in \ZZllll\
decays at 7 \tev\ and 8 \tev, simulated using the \powhegbox\cite{Melia:2011tj} generator
to model the quark-antiquark annihilation process and the \ggtwoZZ\cite{gg2ZZ} generator to
model the gluon-gluon fusion process. 
%In both cases the CT10~\cite{CT10}
%\partDF\ set is used, and the factorisation and renormalisation scales are set
%to $\mu_{R} = \mu_{F} = \mZZ$. 
In~\fig{gen-comp-7-8-ZZ} the kinematic
distributions are plotted after requiring that both \Z\ bosons have \sstooos,
whilst in~\fig{gen-comp-7-8-ZZs} the requirement on the most off-shell \Z\ is
relaxed to \mZgtt. In both cases the distributions of \mZZ, \ptZZ, leading \Z\
\pt\ and the \pt\ of the highest and lowest \pt\ lepton are observed to tend towards
slightly higher energies at 8 \tev\ than at 7 \tev. The pseudo-rapidity
distributions of the highest and lowest \pt\ leptons are observed to be wider at
8 \tev, with a greater fraction of the leptons being at high pseudo-rapidity.

The difference in the \Z\ line-shape observed between \sherpa\ and the other
generators is attributed to the fact that \sherpa\ applies QED FSR in a
different way. For all of the other generators compared in ??, \photos\cite{Golonka:2005pn} is used
to model QED radiation, whereas \sherpa\ has it's own internal treatment. There are two
ways of applying QED radiation to a \ZZllll\ final state. The radiation can
either be applied from the full \llll\ multipole, distributing the recoil within
the multipole, or assuming two separate dipoles, $\Z[\ell\ell]$ and
$\Z[\ell'\ell']$, each
of which undergoes QED radiation independently from each other. The latter
treatment leaves the mass of each dilepton pair invariant, whereas the former
treatment leaves the mass of the four-lepton system invariant. \photos\ uses the
$(\ell\ell)(\ell'\ell')$ approach, whilst the \sherpa\ samples used in Figure ??
use the $(\llll)$ approach. ~\fig{??} shows the difference between the \Z\
lineshape in \sherpa\ samples generated using the two approaches; the \Z\
lineshape in \sherpa\ samples generated using the $(\ell\ell)(\ell'\ell')$ approach agree with the productions from the generators using \photos. It is not  clear which is the correct approach
theoretically~\cite{Siegert}, so additional systematics are assigned to account
for differences resulting from the two approaches.

Non-zero nTGCs would manifest as an increased \ZZ\
production \cx, especially at high \ZZ\ invariant mass and transverse
momentum~\cite{Baur:2000ae}.

\section{Previous experimental results}

Diboson ZZ production was first observed in $e^+e^-$ collisions at LEP in 1997
when the centre of mass energy of the collider first reached 183 \gev, the
threshold for producing two on-shell \Z\ bosons.
The L3 experiment published the first observation and \cx\ measurement
of on-shell \ZZ\ production~\cite{Acciarri1999281}, based on 55.3~\ipb\
of data collected at an average centre-of-mass energy of 182.7 GeV. All visible
decay-channels were used in the measurement. Whilst no events were
observed in the \llll\ final state, a total of 63 were observed in
the other visible final states. The majority (47) of these were in the
all-hadronic channel, which suffered from high backgrounds from $e^+e-
\rightarrow qq \gamma$ and $e^+e- \rightarrow WW$. In this channel a neural
network method was used to distinguish the signal events from the background. A
log-likelihood fit of the neural network output and the observed mass spectra in
the other channels was used to combine the channels, and gave a \cx\ of
$\sigma_{ZZ} = 0.30^{+0.22 +0.07}_{-0.16 -0.03}$, in very good agreement with
the \sm\ prediction. 

Measurements of the \ZZ\ production \cx\ in $e^+e^-$ collisions have
been made by all four LEP experiments at centre of mass energies between 183
\gev\ and 209
\gev~\cite{Abbiendi:2003va,Abdallah:2003dv,Acciarri:1999ug,Schael:1166743}.
These have been combined at each centre of mass energy using a \chisquared\
minimisation technique, taking into account correlations between the systematic
uncertainties~\cite{bib:LEPEW2006}. The resulting combined \cx s as a
function of centre of mass energy are shown in~\fig{lep-cx} and are in good agreement with
theoretical predictions.

    \caption{Measurements of the \ZZ\ production \cx\ in  $e^+e^-$
    collisions as a function of centre of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$. The
    measurements are a combination of measurements from the four LEP
    experiments. Figure from~\cite{bib:LEPEW2006}.}
    \label{fig:lep-cx}
\end{figure}

Each of the LEP experiments also set limits on the \ZZZ\ and \ZZg\ anomalous
triple gauge couplings $f_{i}^{V}$. The limits are set using the measured total
\ZZ\ \cx, as well as kinematic distributions sensitive to to aTGCs.
ALEPH~\cite{Schael:1166743}, DELPHI~\cite{Bambade:1002930} and
OPAL~\cite{Abbiendi:2000kq} use the $\cos(\theta_{Z})$ distribution, where
$\theta_{Z}$ is the production angle of the \Z\ boson with respect to the beam
axis. L3~\cite{Acciarri:1999ug} use fits to different kinematic variables in
each decay channel. Each experiment first combines its limits across the different
decay channels and centre of mass energies, and provides the negative
log-likelihood as a function of the parameter to be combined. Limits are set
varying each parameter independently, holding the other parameters at their
standard model value of zero. Two parameter
fits are also carried out. No deviations from the \sm\ are observed. The
negative log-likelihood distributions from each of the experiments, as well as the
combined negative log-likelihood, are shown in~\fig{lep-tgc}, and the single
parameter limts are given in~\tab{prev-tgc-limits}.

Measurements of the \ZZ\ production \cx\ in $p \bar{p}$
collisions at a centre of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ \tev\ have been made
at the Tevatron by both the D0 and the CDF experiment. D0 measured the \ZZ\ \cx\ in
6.4~\ifb\ of integrated luminosity using the \ZZllll\
channel~\cite{Abazov:2011td} and in 8.6~\ifb\ using the
\ZZllvv\ channel~\cite{Abazov:2012cj}. In the \ZZllll\ channel 10 events
were observed with the requirement that both dilepon pairs have mass above 30
\gev, with an expected background of 0.37 $\pm$ 0.13. Combining the two
channels, the measured \cx\ for \ZZ\ production with the requirement of $60 < m_{\Z}
< 120$ \gev\ was 
\crossSec{p\bar p\ra ZZ}{\measStatSyst{1.44}{\errAsym{0.31}{0.28}}{\errAsym{0.17}{0.19}}~\rm{pb}}, 
in agreement with the \sm\ prediction of \crossSec{p\bar p\ra ZZ}{1.3 \pm 0.1 \, \rm{pb}}. 
The observed kinematic distributions were
also in good agreement with the \sm\ predictions. 

CDF~\cite{CDF:2011ab}
have measured the \ZZ\ \cx\ using the \ZZllvv\ and \ZZllll\
channels in 6 \ifb\ of integrated luminosity. In the \ZZllll\ channel, events
were required to have two \ossf\ lepton pairs, with one pair required to have
invariant mass within $\pm$ 25 \gev\ of the \Z\ mass, and the other in the range
$40 < m_{\ll} < 140$ \gev. 14 such events were observed, with an expect
background of 0.26\errAsym{0.53}{0.15} events. The measured \cx, combining the
two channels and correcting to the zero-width approximation, was \crossSec{p\bar
p\ra ZZ}{1.64\,\errAsym{0.44}{0.38}\, \rm{(stat+syst)\,pb}}, again in agreement with
the \sm\ prediction of \crossSec{p\bar p\ra ZZ}{1.4 \pm 0.1 \, \rm{pb}}.

Both experiments also set limits on aTGCs. D0 set limits using
\ZZllll\ decays in 1~\ifb\ of data~\cite{Abazov:2007ad}, requiring that
both dilepton pairs had an invariant mass $>$ 50 (70) GeV for dimuon (dielectron)
pairs. No events were observed passing this selection. 
Limits were set by comparing observed number of events with the yields predicted in
samples simulated with different values of the anomolous couplings.
 %this is used to form a likelihood for that point. 
 The resulting 95\% confidence limits obtained bu varying one
parameter at a time and holding the rest at zero are shown
in~\tab{prev-tgc-limits}. Two-dimenional limits were also
set.

Recently the CMS experiment have published a measurement of the \ZZ\ production
\cx\ in $pp$ collisions at 7~\tev~\cite{Chatrchyan:1495152} using
\ZZllll\ decays. In a dataset of 5 \ifb\ they select events with two \ossf\ dilepton
pairs, where the first dilepton pair must be composed of electrons or muons and
have a mass $60 < m_{\ll} < 120$ \gev. The second pair may be composed of either
electrons, muons or taus. In the case of the second pair being \ee\ or \mm\ the
same mass cut is applied as for the first pair. In the case of \tautau, the
visible mass is required to satisfy $30 < m_{\tau\tau}^{\rm{vis}} < 80$~\gev.
In the $4e$,$4\mu$ and $2e2\mu$ channels they observed 54 events, with a \sm\ prediction of
\measStatSyst{54.5}{\errSym{0.3}}{\errSym{4.8}} (including a small background
component). In the $2\ell2\tau$ channels,
11 events were observed, with a \sm\ prediction of
\measStatSyst{11.7}{\errSym{0.8}}{\errSym{1.0}} (including 4.4 from background
processes). Combining all final states, the measured \cx, requiring both \Z\
bosons to be in the range 60 $< m_{Z} < 120$ \gev, was found to be \crossSec{p
p\ra
ZZ}{\measStatSystLumi{6.24}{\errAsym{0.86}{0.80}}{\errAsym{0.41}{0.32}}{\errSym{0.14}}\,pb},
in excellent agreement with the \sm\ prediction of 6.3 \errSym{0.4}~pb. Limits
were set on aTGCs using the observed four-lepton mass distribution for the
$4e$,$4\mu$ and $2e2\mu$ channels combined. The observed 95\% confidence limits
on aTGCs from LEP, D0 and CMS are given in~\tab{prev-tgc-limits}.
