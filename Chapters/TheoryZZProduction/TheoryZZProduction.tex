%\section{Introduction}

The study of the production of pairs of \Z\ bosons in particle collisions (so
called \intro{diboson \ZZ\ production}) is of great interest as it provides a
precision test of the \sm, and unique opportunity to probe the structure of the
electroweak sector.  The $ZZZ$ and $ZZ\gamma$ neutral triple gauge boson
couplings (nTGCs) are zero at tree-level in the Standard Model, and exist only
at the level of  $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ in one-loop
corrections~\cite{Gounaris:2000dn}. The size of these nTGCs are, however,
enhanced in many models of new-physics. Measurement of these couplings thus
provides a test of the structure of the electroweak sector of the \sm.

Non-resonant \ZZ\ production is also the irreducible background to \HZZ\ decays,
one of the key channels in Higgs boson physics at the LHC. The
CMS~\cite{CMS_Higgs:2012gu} and ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS_Higgs:2012gk} experiments both
recently reported the discovery of a new boson with mass near 125 \gev\ in the
search for the Higgs boson. \HZZ\ decays were a key search channel for this
discovery, contributing a local significance of 3.6 $\sigma$ to the overall
local significance of 6.0 $\sigma$ (the other contributing channels were \Hgg\
and \HWW). Understanding non-resonant \ZZ\ production was essential for such a
discovery, and continues to be important for studying the properties of the new
boson.

\section{\ZZ\ Production at Hadron Colliders}

At hadron colliders, \qqZZ\ proceeds at tree level via $t$- and $u$-channel
quark-antiquark annihilation as shown in~\fig{theoryzz-fd-qqZZ}. Since \ZZZ\ and
\ZZg\ couplings are forbidden in the \sm\ there is no contribution from
$s$-channel $q\bar{q}$ annihilation. Final states involving an off shell photon
in place of a \Z\ are indistinguishable from the state with a \Z, and so the
\qqZZ\ process involves a small contribution from $\gamma^{*}$, with
interference between the \Z\ diagrams and the $\gamma^{*}$ diagrams. For the
remainder of this thesis, \Z\ is taken to mean \Zorgv.

Gluon-gluon fusion processes will also contribute via quark box diagrams, as
shown in~\fig{theoryzz-fd-ggZZ}. Although these are NNLO and are suppressed by a
factor of $\alpha_s^2$, due to the high gluon content of the proton at LHC
energies they still contribute a sizeable fraction of the total \ZZ\ production
\cx, contributing approximately 5-10\%~\cite{Campbell:2011}, depending on the
centre of mass energy and the definition of the \cx.
%This is discussed in more detail below.

\subsection{\ZZ\ Decay Modes}

\Z\ bosons can decay to a quark-antiquark pair, a neutrino-antineturino pair or
a pair of oppositely charged leptons. The branching fractions to each of the
final states are well known~\cite{PDG}, and are 69.9\% for $q \bar{q}$, 20.0\%
for $\nu\bar{\nu}$ and 10.1\% for \ll. In \ZZ\ decays, each boson decays
independently, so the branching fraction for a given final state is the product
of the branching fractions for the two \Z\ bosons. The measurements in this
thesis are all based on measurements of \ZZllll, where $\ell = e,\mu$, giving
three final states \eeee, \mmmm\ and \eemm. The
branching fractions to these final states are as follows:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{B}(\ZZeeee) = 0.113 \errSym{0.008}\,\% \\
\mathcal{B}(\ZZmmmm) = 0.113 \errSym{0.014}\,\% \\
\mathcal{B}(\ZZeemm) = 0.226 \errSym{0.016}\,\% 
\end{align}

\subsection{Cross Section Definition}
\label{sec:TheoryZZProduction-CxDef}

The \cx\ for non-resonant \ZZ\ production can be defined in a number of
ways. One definition is to use a \intro{zero-width} approximation for the \Z\ bosons and
calculate a total \cx. Alternatively, the natural width of the \Z\
bosons can be used, and requirements made on the invariant masses of the \Z\
bosons to define a \cx. In this thesis, measurements of two total \ZZ\ \cx s
are presented: an \intro{on-shell} \cx\, assuming natural width for the
\Z\ bosons and requiring both bosons have mass in the range \sstooosZ, and a
\cx\ allowing one of the \Z\ bosons to be off shell with $m_{\Z}>20$
\gev.

Measurements are also presented in a restricted phase space, termed a
\intro{fiducial volume}, which corresponds closely to the experimental selection
requirements described in~\chap{ObjEventSelection}. The corresponding
\intro{fiducial \cx} has smaller theoretical uncertainties than the total \cx,
since in extrapolating from the experimentally measured
fiducial \cx\ to the total \cx\ additional uncertainties arise due to uncertainties on the \partDF\ and
the factorisation and renormalisation scales. The fiducial volumes used for the
7 \tev\ and the 8 \tev\ measurements are slightly different, reflecting the
different experimental selections; they are defined below. The fiducial
\cx s are measured using decays where both \Z\ bosons decay to either electrons
or muons, denoted \ZZllll. The fiducial
\cx s are then extrapolated to the total \cx\ correcting for
the geometric acceptance of the fiducial volume and the branching
fractions to leptons.

\subsubsection{7 \tev\ Fiducial Cross Section Definitions}

The \ZZllll\ on-shell (\ZZ) fiducial \cx\ is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\ZorgZorgllll, $\ell = e,\mu$;}
\item{ $66 < m_{12}(\Zorgv) <  116\GeV$, where $m_{12}(\Zorgv)$ is
the mass of the \Z\ reconstructed from the first and second leptons.  The
lepton pairings are assigned by choosing the set of 
same-flavor, opposite-sign lepton pairs that minimises the sum of distances from
the \Z\ boson mass~\cite{PDG}:
\begin{equation}
|m_{1,2}(\Zorgv) - \mZPDG| + |m_{3,4}(\Zorgv) - \mZPDG|
\end{equation}
}
\item{ $66 < m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*) <  116\GeV$, where $m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*)$ is
the mass of the \Z\ reconstructed from the third and fourth leptons;}
\item All four leptons have transverse momentum satisfying $\pT^{\ell} > 7\GeV$;
\item All four leptons have pseudo-rapidity satisfying $|\eta^{\ell}| < 3.16$;
\item{ The minimum distance between any two leptons in the event must satisfy
$\mathrm{min}(\dR(\ell,\ell)) > 0.2$, where $\dR = \sqrt{\Delta \phi^{2} +
\Delta \eta^{2}}$.}
\end{itemize}

The \ZZsllll\ fiducial \cx , allowing one \Z\ to be off-shell ($ZZ^*$), is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
\item $(\Z/\gamma^*)(\Z/\gamma^*)\rightarrow\ll\ll$, $\ell = e,\mu$;
\item $66 < m_{12}(\Z/\gamma^*) <  116\GeV$;
\item $m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*) > 20\GeV$;
\item All leptons satisfying the same kinematics requirements as above:
$\pT^{\ell} > 7\GeV$,
$|\eta^{\ell}| < 3.16$,
and $\mathrm{min}(|\Delta R(\ell,\ell)|) > 0.2$.
\end{itemize}

In this case the tighter mass cut is applied to the dilepton pair furthest from the \Z\
boson mass.

\subsubsection{8 \tev\ Fiducial Cross Section Definitions}

For the 8~\tev\ data, only a measurement of the on-shell (\ZZ) \cx\ is
presented. The fiducial volume is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\ZorgZorgllll, $\ell = e,\mu$;}
\item{ $66 < m_{12}(\Zorgv) <  116\GeV$, where $m_{12}(\Zorgv)$ is
the mass of the \Z\ reconstructed from the first and second leptons.  The
lepton pairings are assigned by choosing the set of 
same-flavor, opposite-sign lepton pairs that minimises the sum of distances from
the \Z\ boson mass~\cite{PDG}:
\begin{equation}
|m_{1,2}(\Zorgv) - \mZPDG| + |m_{3,4}(\Zorgv) - \mZPDG|
\end{equation}
}
\item{ $66 < m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*) <  116\GeV$, where $m_{34}(\Z/\gamma^*)$ is
the mass of the \Z\ reconstructed from the third and fourth leptons;}
\item All four leptons have transverse momentum satisfying $\pT^{\ell} > 7\GeV$;
\item All four leptons have pseudo-rapidity satisfying $|\eta^{\ell}| < 2.7$;
\item{ The minimum distance between any two leptons in the event must satisfy
$\mathrm{min}(\dR(\ell,\ell)) > 0.2$, where $\dR = \sqrt{\Delta \phi^{2} +
\Delta \eta^{2}}$.}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cross Section}

~\tab{cx-eemm-mcfm} shows \cx s for the \ZZeemm\ process at 7 \tev\ and
at 8 \tev, calculated using version 6.3 of the
\mcfm~\cite{Campbell:2011} program. The \cx\  in the zero-width approximation is shown, as
well as the \cx s allowing for the natural width of the \Z\ boson and
applying mass cuts.  The \cx s after applying the requirements defining
the fiducial volume are also shown. 
In all cases, the CT10~\cite{CT10} \partDF\ set is used, and the factorisation and renormalisation scales are set
to $\mu_{R} = \mu_{F} = \frac{1}{2} \mZZ$. The error due to the \partDF\ 
uncertainty is
evaluated by using the 52 CT10 error sets and by taking the difference in \cx\ 
obtained when using the MSTW08NLO~\cite{bib:MSTW2008} \partDF\ set. The error 
due to the choice of
\fact\ and \renorm\ scales is evaluated by varying them
simultaneously up and down by a factor of two. The contribution from the
\gammas\ diagram is included in the calculation.

Total \cx s are shown in~\tab{cx-total-mcfm}. These are also
calculated using the \mcfm\ program as described above, by
calculating the \cx\  for \ZZeemm\ then correcting for the branching
fraction $\mathcal{B}(\ZZeemm)$. 

The percentage contributions from
gluon-gluon fusion processes are shown in~\tab{theory-gg-frac}.

\section{Kinematic distributions}

\subsection{Comparison of \ZZllll\ at 7 \tev\ and 8 \tev}

Figures~\ref{fig:gen-comp-7-8-ZZ} and ~\ref{fig:gen-comp-7-8-ZZs} show comparisons of the kinematic distributions in \ZZllll\
decays at 7 \tev\ and 8 \tev, simulated using the \powhegbox\cite{Melia:2011tj} generator
to model the quark-antiquark annihilation process and the \ggtwoZZ\cite{gg2ZZ} generator to
model the gluon-gluon fusion process. 
%In both cases the CT10~\cite{CT10}
%\partDF\ set is used, and the factorisation and renormalisation scales are set
%to $\mu_{R} = \mu_{F} = \mZZ$. 
In~\fig{gen-comp-7-8-ZZ} the kinematic
distributions are plotted after requiring that both \Z\ bosons have \sstooos,
whilst in~\fig{gen-comp-7-8-ZZs} the requirement on the most off-shell \Z\ is
relaxed to \mZgtt. In both cases the distributions of \mZZ, \ptZZ, leading \Z\
\pt\ and the \pt\ of the highest and lowest \pt\ lepton are observed to tend towards
slightly higher energies at 8 \tev\ than at 7 \tev. The pseudo-rapidity
distributions of the highest and lowest \pt\ leptons are observed to be wider at
8 \tev, with a greater fraction of the leptons at high pseudo-rapidity.

\subsection{Comparison of \ggZZ\ and \qqZZ}

~\fig{gen-comp-gg-qq-ZZ} shows a comparison of kinematic distributions in \ggZZ\ 
(simulated using \ggtwoZZ) and \qqZZ\ events (simulated using \powhegbox), 
requiring that both \Z\ bosons have \sstooos. 
%~\fig{gen-comp-gg-qq-ZZs} shows 
%the same distributions after relaxing the requirement on the \Z\ furthest from 
%the \Z\ pole to $m_{Z}>20$ \gev. 
The \mZZ\ distribution is similar in both 
processes, however the \ptZZ\ distribution is much harder in the case of \ggZZ.  
This can be attributed to increased initial state radiation in the gluon-gluon 
fusion process. As a consequence of this, the leading \Z\ \pt\ distribution is 
slightly harder in the \ggZZ\ process, whilst the subleading \Z\ \pt\ is 
slightly softer. The leptons produced in \ggZZ\ decays are much more central in
$\eta$, 
and have slightly higher \pt\ on average than in \qqZZ\ decays.

Figures~\ref{fig:gen-comp-ZZ} and~\ref{fig:gen-comp-mZ} show 
comparisons of kinematic distributions in \qqZZ
$\ra\eemm$ 
events generated using different \mc\ generators. The generators compared are
\sherpa, \mcatnlo, \powhegbox, \herwig, \herwigPP\ and \pythia; descriptions of
these generators are given in~\sec{Theory-MC-gen}. In all figures both \Z\
bosons are required to have have \sstooos. 

There is generally good agreement between different generators in the
four-lepton invariant mass (\mZZ)
distribution, although \sherpa\ produces a larger low tail, and \mcatnlo\ gives
a much softer distribution. Similarly \mcatnlo\ gives a softer distribution
for the four-lepton transverse momentum compared to the other generators,
whilst \pythia\ gives a harder distribution. \herwig\ gives harder transverse
momentum distributions for both \Z\ bosons, and consequently harder
distributions for the hardest and the softest lepton. Conversely, \mcatnlo\ gives
softer transverse momentum distributions for the \Z\ bosons, and consequently
softer transverse momentum distributions for the hardest and the softest lepton.

% Generally good agreement in mZZ, except Sherpa has larger low tail.
% ptZZ
% Herwig harder in ptZZ, ptZ1, ptZ2
% Z1 softer in mcatnlo (and consequently lep1 softer). Also mZZ much softer in
% mcatnlo
% Most generators harder than Sherpa in pT lep1, pT lep4

~\fig{gen-comp-mZ} shows the invariant mass distribution of the di-electron and
di-muon pairs. Good agreement is seen between the different generators, with
the exception of \mcatnlo, which uses a zero-width approximation for the \Z\
bosons, and \sherpa, which is seen to have a slightly wider \Z\ lineshape.

The difference in the \Z\ line-shape observed between \sherpa\ and the other
generators is attributed to the fact that \sherpa\ applies QED FSR in a
different way. For all of the other generators compared in~\fig{gen-comp-mZ}, 
\photos~\cite{Golonka:2005pn} is used
to model QED radiation, whereas \sherpa\ has its own internal treatment. 

There are two
ways of applying QED radiation to a \ZZllll\ final state. The radiation can
either be applied from the full four-lepton multipole, distributing the recoil within
the multipole, or assuming two separate dipoles, $\Z[\ell\ell]$ and
$\Z[\ell'\ell']$, each
of which undergoes QED radiation independently from each other. The latter
treatment leaves the mass of each dilepton pair and of the four-lepton system invariant, whereas the former
treatment leaves only the mass of the four-lepton system invariant. \photos\ uses the
$(\ell\ell)(\ell'\ell')$ approach, whilst the \sherpa\ samples used in
~\fig{gen-comp-mZ}
use the $(llll)$ approach. 

~\fig{gen-comp-SherpaQED} shows the difference 
between the \Z\
lineshape in \sherpa\ samples generated using the two approaches; the \Z\
lineshape in \sherpa\ samples generated using the $(\ell\ell)(\ell'\ell')$ approach agree with the predictions from the generators using \photos. It is not  clear which is the correct approach
theoretically~\cite{Siegert}, so additional systematics are assigned to account
for differences resulting from the two approaches.

\section{Anomalous Triple Gauge Couplings}

The \ZZZ\ and \ZZg\ vertices are forbidden at tree level
in the \sm, and arise 
and only
at the level of  $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ in one-loop
corrections~\cite{Gounaris:2000dn}.
Such couplings may however arise as the result of contributions from New Physics (NP).
Additional triple gauge couplings are introduced by means of an effective
Lagrangian framework. The basic assumption is that there is some NP beyond the
\sm\ at a mass scale $\Lambda$, far beyond the reach of current experiments. The resulting
new particles are thus not directly observable, and the only observable effect
of the NP is anomalous interactions of SM particles. Since in \ZZV\ couplings
there are always at least two identical particles, Bose statistics forbid \ZZV\
vertices with all particles on-shell; at least one of the bosons must thus be
off-shell. The most general form of the anomalous couplings, assuming Lorentz
and $U(1)_{EM}$ gauge invariance, gives two independent couplings for each of
the \ZZV\ vertices or four parameters in total. Two of these, denoted
\ffourZ\ and \ffourg\ give rise to CP violating interactions, whilst the
remaining two, \ffiveZ\ and \ffiveg\ give CP conserving interactions. A priori
there is no relation between these couplings. 

The most general form of the Lagrangian for the effective theory is~\cite{Gounaris:1999kf}:

\begin{align}
\Lagr = \frac{e}{m_{Z}^{2}} \left[ 
\ffourV(\partial_{\mu}V^{\mu\beta})Z_{\alpha}(\partial^{\alpha}Z_{\beta}) +
\ffiveV(\partial^{\mu}V_{\mu\alpha})(\tilde{Z}^{\alpha\beta}Z_{\beta}) \right]
\end{align}

where $V=Z,A$ for the \Z\ or photon tensor, $\tilde{Z}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2}
\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}Z^{\rho\sigma}$ and $V_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}V_{\nu}
- \partial_{\nu}V_{\mu}$.

Since the departure from the SM prediction grows rapidly with \sqrtshat\ and may
eventually violate unitarity, it is conventional to apply a \intro{form
factor} to the basic couplings given above, in order to maintain unitarity at
high \sqrtshat. The form factor is applied as:

\begin{align}
\fiV(\shat) = \frac{f^{V}_{i,0}}{(1 + \shat / \Lambda)^{n}}
\end{align}

where $i=4,5$, $V=Z,\gamma$ and $\Lambda$ is taken to be the scale at which the
new physics becomes directly observable. $n$ gives the power of the form factor,
and is generally taken to be $n=3$~\cite{Baur:2000ae}. For limits derived at a
fixed \shat\ it is trivial to convert between coupling parameters derived with
different choices of $\Lambda$ and $n$ and at different values of \shat. 
Unfortunately at hadron colliders limits arise
from integration of a range of \shat, so it is not possible to compare
limits derived at different $\Lambda$ $n$ or for different ranges of \shat. 
Limits are therefore often also derived
without a form factor (or equivalently taking $\Lambda = \infty$) to allow
comparison between the results of different experiments

\subsection{Origin of aTGCs}


The simplest model for generating anomalous neutral TGCs is from heavy fermion
loops arising from a new generation of fermions; this is shown in~\fig{heavy-F-loop}. New heavy fermions arise
in many models beyond the SM, such as SUSY, GUTs and Technicolor.
Such
loops can only generate the CP-conserving couplings \ffiveV; higher-order
processes are needed to generate CP-violating couplings \ffourV. A heavy fermion
with \sm\ couplings to the \Z\ and $\gamma$, would give couplings~\cite{Gounaris:2000tb}:

\begin{align}
\ffiveV \propto \frac{\alpha}{4\pi} \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{M_{F}^{2}}
\label{tgc-from-heavyF-loop-strength}
\end{align}

where $M_{F}$ is the heavy fermion mass. If the new family of heavy fermions
were exactly degenerate in mass, the couplings would vanish as the combination of heavy
fermion contributions would exactly cancel. If there was a mass splitting between doublets in the new family of
order $m_{Z}$ the couplings could be restored, but would be $\propto
m_{Z}^{4} / M_{F}^{4}$ and thus heavily suppressed. In a more
experimentally favourable scenario, if one particle of the family had a mass far
lower than the rest of the family, the coupling would be restored with a
strength similar to that give in Equation~\ref{tgc-from-heavyF-loop-strength}.
This is still suppressed by the loop $\alpha / 4\pi$ factor, and yields
anomalous couplings of order $10^{-3}$ for $M_F$ in the 100 \gev\ range.
Contributions from loops
of SM particles generate loops at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$.

One concrete example of a NP model giving rise to anomalous TGCs in
Supersymmetry in the MSSM~\cite{Gounaris:2000tb}. In the MSSM the
additional fermion loop diagrams would arise from charginos and neutralinos. The
charginos couple to the gauge bosons through their gaugino and higgsino
components and so contribute to the \ffiveZ\ and \ffiveg\ couplings. The
neutralinos only contribute through the higgsino coupling, so only
contribute to the \ffiveZ\ coupling.

\subsection{Signatures at hadron colliders}

Non-zero nTGCs would manifest as an increased \ZZ\
production \cx, particularly at high \sqrtshat. This means that the enhancement
of the cross-section is most apparent at high \ZZ\ invariant mass and transverse
momentum~\cite{Baur:2000ae}, and at large scattering angles. ~\fig{gen-comp-TGC}
shows the \mZZ\ and \pt\ of the leading \Z\ boson in \sm\ \ZZllll\ decays, as
well as in \ZZllll\ decays in four samples generated with anomalous
nTGCs included in the simulation. The nTGC samples are generated with couplings
close to the limits derived from previous experiments
(see~\sec{TheoryZZProduction-prevResults}), and with $\Lambda=3\tev$ and $n=3$.
As expected, the presence of nTGCs manifests as enhanced event counts at high
\mZZ\ and leading \Z\ \pt.

\section{Previous experimental results}
\label{sec:TheoryZZProduction-prevResults}

Diboson ZZ production was first observed in $e^+e^-$ collisions at LEP in 1997
when the centre of mass energy of the collider first reached 183 \gev, the
threshold for producing two on-shell \Z\ bosons.
The L3 experiment published the first observation and \cx\ measurement
of on-shell \ZZ\ production~\cite{Acciarri1999281}, based on 55.3~\ipb\
of data collected at an average centre-of-mass energy of 182.7 GeV. All visible
decay-channels were used in the measurement. Whilst no events were
observed in the \llll\ final state, a total of 63 were observed in
the other visible final states. The majority (47) of these were in the
all-hadronic channel, which suffered from high backgrounds from $e^+e-
\rightarrow qq \gamma$ and $e^+e- \rightarrow WW$. In this channel a neural
network method was used to distinguish the signal events from the background. A
log-likelihood fit of the neural network output and the observed mass spectra in
the other channels was used to combine the channels, and gave a \cx\ of
$\sigma_{ZZ} = 0.30^{+0.22 +0.07}_{-0.16 -0.03}$, in very good agreement with
the \sm\ prediction. 

Measurements of the \ZZ\ production \cx\ in $e^+e^-$ collisions have since
been made by all four LEP experiments at centre of mass energies between 183
\gev\ and 209
\gev~\cite{Abbiendi:2003va,Abdallah:2003dv,Acciarri:1999ug,Schael:1166743}.
These have been combined at each centre of mass energy using a \chisquared\
minimisation technique, taking into account correlations between the systematic
uncertainties~\cite{bib:LEPEW2006}. The resulting combined \cx s as a
function of centre of mass energy, shown in~\fig{lep-cx}, are in good agreement with
theoretical predictions.

        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{lep_cx}

    measurements are a combination of measurements from the four LEP
    experiments. Figure from~\cite{bib:LEPEW2006}.}
    \label{fig:lep-cx}
\end{figure}

Each of the LEP experiments also set limits on the \ZZZ\ and \ZZg\ anomalous
triple gauge couplings $f_{i}^{V}$. The limits are set using the measured total
\ZZ\ \cx, as well as kinematic distributions sensitive to to aTGCs.
ALEPH~\cite{Schael:1166743}, DELPHI~\cite{Bambade:1002930} and
OPAL~\cite{Abbiendi:2000kq} use the $\cos(\theta_{Z})$ distribution, where
$\theta_{Z}$ is the production angle of the \Z\ boson with respect to the beam
axis. L3~\cite{Acciarri:1999ug} use fits to different kinematic variables in
each decay channel. Each experiment first combines its limits across the different
decay channels and centre of mass energies, and provides the negative
log-likelihood as a function of the parameter to be combined. Limits are set
varying each parameter independently, holding the other parameters at their
standard model value of zero. Two parameter
fits are also carried out. No deviations from the \sm\ are observed. The
negative log-likelihood distributions from each of the experiments, as well as the
combined negative log-likelihood, are shown in~\fig{lep-tgc}, and the single
parameter limits are given in~\tab{prev-tgc-limits}.

\end{figure}

Measurements of the \ZZ\ production \cx\ in $p \bar{p}$
collisions at a centre of mass energy of \sqrtseq{1.96} have been made
at the Tevatron by both the D0 and the CDF experiments. D0 measured the \ZZ\ \cx\ in
6.4~\ifb\ of integrated luminosity using the \ZZllll\
channel~\cite{Abazov:2011td} and in 8.6~\ifb\ using the
\ZZllvv\ channel~\cite{Abazov:2012cj}. In the \ZZllll\ channel 10 events
were observed with the requirement that both dilepton pairs have mass above 30
\gev, with an expected background of 0.37 $\pm$ 0.13 events. Combining the two
channels, the measured \cx\ for \ZZ\ production with the requirement of $60 < m_{\Z}
< 120$ \gev\ was 
\crossSec{p\bar p\ra ZZ}{\measStatSyst{1.44}{\errAsym{0.31}{0.28}}{\errAsym{0.17}{0.19}}~\rm{pb}}, 
in agreement with the \sm\ prediction of \crossSec{p\bar p\ra ZZ}{1.3 \pm 0.1 \, \rm{pb}}. 
The observed kinematic distributions were
also in good agreement with the \sm\ predictions. 

CDF~\cite{CDF:2011ab}
have measured the \ZZ\ \cx\ using the \ZZllvv\ and \ZZllll\
channels in 6 \ifb\ of integrated luminosity. In the \ZZllll\ channel, events
were required to have two \ossf\ lepton pairs, with one pair required to have
invariant mass within $\pm$ 25 \gev\ of the \Z\ mass, and the other in the range
$40 < m_{\ll} < 140$ \gev. 14 such events were observed, with an expect
background of 0.26\errAsym{0.53}{0.15} events. The measured \cx, combining the
two channels and correcting to the zero-width approximation, was \crossSec{p\bar
p\ra ZZ}{1.64\,\errAsym{0.44}{0.38}\, \rm{(stat+syst)\,pb}}, again in agreement with
the \sm\ prediction of \crossSec{p\bar p\ra ZZ}{1.4 \pm 0.1 \, \rm{pb}}.

D0 set limits on aTGCs using
\ZZllll\ decays in 1~\ifb\ of data~\cite{Abazov:2007ad}, requiring that
both dilepton pairs had an invariant mass $>$ 50 (70) GeV for di-muon (di-electron)
pairs. No events were observed passing this selection. 
Limits were set by comparing observed number of events with the yields predicted in
samples simulated with different values of the anomalous couplings.
 %this is used to form a likelihood for that point. 
 The resulting 95\% confidence limits obtained bu varying one
parameter at a time and holding the rest at zero are shown
in~\tab{prev-tgc-limits}. Two-dimensional limits were also
set.

Recently the CMS experiment have published a measurement of the \ZZ\ production
\cx\ in $pp$ collisions at 7~\tev~\cite{Chatrchyan:1495152} using
\ZZllll\ decays. In a dataset of 5 \ifb\ they select events with two \ossf\ dilepton
pairs, where the first dilepton pair must be composed of electrons or muons and
have a mass $60 < m_{\ll} < 120$ \gev. The second pair may be composed of either
electrons, muons or taus. In the case of the second pair being \ee\ or \mm\ the
same mass cut is applied as for the first pair. In the case of \tautau, the
visible mass is required to satisfy $30 < m_{\tau\tau}^{\rm{vis}} < 80$~\gev.
In the $4e$,$4\mu$ and $2e2\mu$ channels they observed 54 events, with a \sm\ prediction of
\measStatSyst{54.5}{\errSym{0.3}}{\errSym{4.8}} (including a small background
component). In the $2\ell2\tau$ channels,
11 events were observed, with a \sm\ prediction of
\measStatSyst{11.7}{\errSym{0.8}}{\errSym{1.0}} (including 4.4 from background
processes). Combining all final states, the measured \cx, requiring both \Z\
bosons to be in the range 60 $< m_{Z} < 120$ \gev, was found to be \crossSec{p
p\ra
ZZ}{\measStatSystLumi{6.24}{\errAsym{0.86}{0.80}}{\errAsym{0.41}{0.32}}{\errSym{0.14}}\,pb},
in excellent agreement with the \sm\ prediction of 6.3 \errSym{0.4}~pb. Limits
were set on aTGCs using the observed four-lepton mass distribution for the
$4e$,$4\mu$ and $2e2\mu$ channels combined. The observed 95\% confidence limits
on aTGCs from LEP, D0 and CMS are given in~\tab{prev-tgc-limits}.
